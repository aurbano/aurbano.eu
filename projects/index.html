<small>2017</small></h4><p class=card-text><p>Online community and platform for code workshops and challenges. Used by universities and companies to run events for students, interns, employees&mldr;</p><p>We provide all the technology + experienced mentors from the industry to our events. Students come to the events from local universities thanks to the support of our partner student-led tech societies.</p><p>Our first Workshop was <a href=https://socialgorithm.org/docs/sections/participate/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/>Ultimate Tic Tac Toe</a>, which works really well for a 1 day event. The ideal solution involves a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm so it allows students to practice some pretty cool programming.</p><p>We&rsquo;re also working on a <strong>Self Driving car race</strong> and a <strong>Bee Hive simulation</strong> game, both aiming at allowing students to practice Deep Learning solutions.</p></p></div></div><div class="card my-4 shadow"><img class=card-img-top src=/assets/files/screenshots/vayaconazo.jpg alt=VayaCoñazo><div class=card-body><h4 class=card-title><a href=https://aurbano.eu>VayaCoñazo</a>
<small>2013</small></h4><p class=card-text><p>An entertainment site, mixing an RSS aggregator and a &ldquo;rage comic&rdquo; site where users submit their content. It pulls content from its own database and a lot other sources, combining everything on the same feed.</p><p>There is also a video viewer that displays the latest videos in a nice AJAX interface, I actually used the video viewer quite more often than the actual site, it&rsquo;s a nice way to spend 10 minutes. Every single video that ever goes viral or becomes famous appears on this viewer some time before.</p><p>This website saw quite a bit of traffic, so in order to make it efficient I wrote a backend in PHP that ran on a cronjob, generating JSON files for all the content on the site (mainly the Hot, New, and Trending lists). This effectively turned it into a blazing-fast static site, where upvotes would influence the content only every minute or so.</p><p>I eventually closed it down when I got my first full time job because I wasn&rsquo;t sure of the legal side of aggregating content from multiple sources.</p></p></div><div class=card-footer><small class=text-danger>Offline</small></div></div><div class="card my-4 shadow"><img class=card-img-top src=/assets/files/screenshots/nuophoto.jpg alt=nuophoto><div class=card-body><h4 class=card-title><a href=https://aurbano.github.io/nuophoto/>nuophoto</a>
<small>2013</small></h4><p class=card-text><p>HTML5, canvas, JavaScript experiment. I&rsquo;ve always been interested in image manipulation, so I decided to build this. It does image processing using convolution matrices and some creative canvas tricks.</p><p>It&rsquo;s a mix of two different libraries, all created from scratch for this project: a GUI controller and an <a href=https://aurbano.github.io/photojshop/>image editing library</a>.</p></p></div></div><div class="card my-4 shadow"><img class=card-img-top src=/assets/files/screenshots/cloudclient.jpg alt=CloudClient><div class=card-body><h4 class=card-title><a href=https://github.com/aurbano/Cloudclient>CloudClient</a>
<small>2012</small></h4><p class=card-text><p>An experiment integrating an API with JavaScript. It&rsquo;s fully open source if you want to take a look.</p><p>Back then I was in uni and saw that Dropbox offered some very cool internships, so I built this in the hopes that it would help get one (it didn&rsquo;t :( ) I also though I could create an amazing interface for cloud storage services, trying to make the web app look like the Windows explorer.</p><p>I did learn a lot of JavaScript, while failing to do an amazing interface. But thanks to this project I learned to setup OAuth, integrate with a fairly complex REST API and expose a fake &ldquo;file system&rdquo; API in PHP so that my frontend could look like it was an actual file explorer.</p><p>The full source code can be found on Github, there might be some useful parts.</p></p></div><div class=card-footer><small class=text-danger>Offline</small></div></div><div class="card my-4 shadow"><img class=card-img-top src=/assets/files/screenshots/quepiensas.jpg alt=QuePiensas><div class=card-body><h4 class=card-title><a href=https://github.com/aurbano/QuePiensas>QuePiensas</a>
<small>2011</small></h4><p class=card-text><p>Spanish (failed) social network fully integrated with Facebook. It alows users to express their opinion on their friends. I&rsquo;m still sure that this idea can become popular, it&rsquo;s just that we didn&rsquo;t achieve the right user experience. Building everything from scratch was a serious effort that helped us learn a lot, but made development too slow. We had no reusable CSS or components, no MVC architecture, nothing really&mldr;</p><p>At some point I will surely give it another go, although this time as an app, they have far more potential I think.</p><p>It was built from scratch by <a href=http://jaicab.com/>Jaime Caballero</a> and me. It uses jQuery, lots of (awful) AJAX and a PHP backend.</p></p></div><div class=card-footer><small class=text-danger>Offline</small></div></div><div class="card my-4 shadow"><img class=card-img-top src=/assets/files/screenshots/chevismo.jpg alt=Chevismo><div class=card-body><h4 class=card-title><a href=https://chevismo.com>Chevismo</a>
<small>2009</small></h4><p class=card-text><p>Entertainment site featuring many popular tools and services. Also a chat, forum, and many other sections that users discover over time.</p><p>This was mostly done to experiment with some new programming concepts, but it got quite popular in Spain so I kept on working on it for several years, making a few good friends in the community that it formed :)</p><p>The chat was the main feature, and some people kept coming back for some reason, eventually forming a very tight community. It was built before Nodejs and Socket.io were a thing, so I built it on top of MySQL with just INSERTS and SELECTS. Some JavaScript would poll this server on a varying interval depending on how active the chat was at the time. This taught me a lot about how efficient a DB can be if tuned properly.</p><p>Once the site became popular I started having issues with abuse and spam, so I added a system that would shadow-ban users who misbehaved. I even added some fake replies to their chat posts so the ban would be even harder to detect.</p><p>All in all it was a blast running this and I plan on recreating something similar soon (2020)</p></p></div></div><div class="card my-4 shadow"><img class=card-img-top src=/assets/files/screenshots/djs_music.jpg alt="DJs Music"><div class=card-body><h4 class=card-title><a href=https://djs-music.com>DJs Music</a>
<small>2007</small></h4><p class=card-text><p>Music sharing website where independent DJs upload their mixes and original songs, packed with features developed over the years.</p><p>The site is now translated in 5 languages, and is popular in many different countries (although most notably in India).</p><p>Google decided one day that I was braching the AdSense ToS without an explanation so I could no longer monetize it&mldr; This was a tough blow for my motivation because I had managed a steady 500$/month as a teenager with it and suddenly it was gone. I believe it was due to someone uploading a copyrighted song, so I revamped a lot my copyright claims handling system but I wasn&rsquo;t able to have my AdSense account reopened.</p><p>I still kept the website online for years, reaching a monthly bandwidth of <strong>3 Terabytes</strong> at some point. Unfortunately it was costly to keep it online and I wasn&rsquo;t able to monetize it, so I closed it in January 2020, 13 years after opening.</p><p>This project taught me a ton about infrastructure, databases, asset optimization and distribution, and coding in general, I just wish it could&rsquo;ve become a side-business to run over the years&mldr;</p></p></div></div></div></div></div></main><footer><p class="copyright text-muted"><a href=/>Alejandro U.
