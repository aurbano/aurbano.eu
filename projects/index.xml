Used by universities and companies to run events for students, interns, employees&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We provide all the technology + experienced mentors from the industry to our events. Students come to the events from local universities thanks to the support of our partner student-led tech societies.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Our first Workshop was &lt;a href="https://socialgorithm.org/docs/sections/participate/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/"&gt;Ultimate Tic Tac Toe&lt;/a&gt;, which works really well for a 1 day event. The ideal solution involves a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm so it allows students to practice some pretty cool programming.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>VayaCoñazo</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2013-vayaconazo/</link><pubDate>Tue, 01 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2013-vayaconazo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;An entertainment site, mixing an RSS aggregator and a &amp;ldquo;rage comic&amp;rdquo; site where users submit their content. It pulls content from its own database and a lot other sources, combining everything on the same feed.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;There is also a video viewer that displays the latest videos in a nice AJAX interface, I actually used the video viewer quite more often than the actual site, it&amp;rsquo;s a nice way to spend 10 minutes. Every single video that ever goes viral or becomes famous appears on this viewer some time before.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>CloudClient</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2012-cloudclient/</link><pubDate>Sun, 01 Jan 2012 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2012-cloudclient/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;An experiment integrating an API with JavaScript. It&amp;rsquo;s fully open source if you want to take a look.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Back then I was in uni and saw that Dropbox offered some very cool internships, so I built this in the hopes that it would help get one (it didn&amp;rsquo;t :( ) I also though I could create an amazing interface for cloud storage services, trying to make the web app look like the Windows explorer.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>QuePiensas</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2011-quepiensas/</link><pubDate>Sat, 01 Jan 2011 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2011-quepiensas/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Spanish (failed) social network fully integrated with Facebook. It alows users to express their opinion on their friends. I&amp;rsquo;m still sure that this idea can become popular, it&amp;rsquo;s just that we didn&amp;rsquo;t achieve the right user experience. Building everything from scratch was a serious effort that helped us learn a lot, but made development too slow. We had no reusable CSS or components, no MVC architecture, nothing really&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I will surely give it another go, although this time as an app, they have far more potential I think.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Chevismo</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2009-chevismo/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 Jan 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2009-chevismo/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Entertainment site featuring many popular tools and services. Also a chat, forum, and many other sections that users discovered over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This was mostly done to experiment with some new programming concepts, but it got quite popular in Spain so I kept on working on it for several years, making a few good friends in the community that it formed :)&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The chat was the main feature, and some people kept coming back for some reason, eventually forming a very tight community. It was built before Nodejs and Socket.io were a thing, so I built it on top of MySQL with just INSERTS and SELECTS. Some JavaScript would poll this server on a varying interval depending on how active the chat was at the time. This taught me a lot about how efficient a DB can be if tuned properly.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>DJs Music</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2007-djsmusic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 2007 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2007-djsmusic/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Music sharing website where independent DJs upload their mixes and original songs, packed with features developed over the years.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;The site is now translated in 5 languages, and is popular in many different countries (although most notably in India).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Google decided one day that I was braching the AdSense ToS without an explanation so I could no longer monetize it&amp;hellip; This was a tough blow for my motivation because I had managed a steady 500$/month as a teenager with it and suddenly it was gone. I believe it was due to someone uploading a copyrighted song, so I revamped a lot my copyright claims handling system but I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to have my AdSense account reopened.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
