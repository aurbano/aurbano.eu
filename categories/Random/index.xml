Which she set herself last time I was with them (because she couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember the previous one). So I saved it in my password manager just in case&amp;hellip;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;They basically have all sessions logged in on their phones and computers, and use &amp;ldquo;Forgot my password&amp;rdquo; whenever they actually need to login to anything. Because of that they end up choosing some random new password for each service every time that happens, and obviously forget it the next time they need it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Mac: Shanghai to Spain</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2014-10-21-mac-shanghai-to-spain/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2014-10-21-mac-shanghai-to-spain/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;I just ordered a new Macbook Air, exactly when the October 16&lt;sup&gt;th&lt;/sup&gt; Keynote was over (In case they presented a new one with retina display).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So now I can only wait for it to arrive, quite excited about this, since it means getting new technology I&amp;rsquo;m not used to. It&amp;rsquo;s a pity they don&amp;rsquo;t offer express shipping, UPS takes 7 days to get it to Spain.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;In order to make the wait less painful I did a quick script to parse the UPS tracking page and draw the locations on Scribble Maps:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
