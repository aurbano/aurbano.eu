He's doing the classic &amp;ldquo;find the n-th prime&amp;rdquo; algorithm, that has a typical recursive solution. It includes a snippet that solves the problem in a way that's just as beautiful as it is impossible to understand for me right now, without any Haskell knowledge.
So I've decided to (finally) start my Journey into Haskell by understanding how that snippet works.</description></item><item><title>Creating a game with Unreal Engine 4</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2014-10-08-creating-game-unreal-engine/</link><pubDate>Wed, 08 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2014-10-08-creating-game-unreal-engine/</guid><description>Github just started giving out &amp;ldquo;Student packs&amp;quot;, which include quite a big list of gifts, including a 1 year license of Unreal Engine. I decided to use that to create a game and learn about game development all together.
Unreal Engine Browser Step 1 At first I decided to take a look at sample games, to get an idea of the project structure. It comes with a bootstrap for most types of games, so I started with an FPS one.</description></item></channel></rss>
