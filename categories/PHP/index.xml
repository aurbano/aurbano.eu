For example 1 minute ago, 2 weeks ago, 1 year ago&amp;hellip;
You can specify the word you want to appear instead of ago by setting the $ago argument to something else as well.
I moved this code to a Github Gist, available here:</description></item><item><title>Did you mean?

Si I started thinking for the easiest way to do this.
There are actually a lot of php functions out there to look for similar text. The most obvious one?
similar_text()
similar_text â€” Calculate the similarity between two strings
You must pass 2 parameters plus an optional third.</description></item><item><title>Get full domain from user's URL in php</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/note/wp/2008-05-28-get-full-domain-from-users-url-in-php/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/note/wp/2008-05-28-get-full-domain-from-users-url-in-php/</guid><description>What I'm going to post here is a php function that will create a standard url from a user-inputted url so that any string will be converted to a functioning url.
First it will convert all characters to lowercase:
$url = strtolower($url); Now add http:// if it is not at the beggining:
if(strncasecmp(&amp;#39;http://&amp;#39;,$url,7) !== 0){ //There is no http:// at the beginning: $url = &amp;#39;http://&amp;#39;.$url; } What strncasecmp does is it takes a string, and then a number.</description></item><item><title>Changing WP Table prefixes</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/note/wp/2008-04-14-changing-wp-table-prefixes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/note/wp/2008-04-14-changing-wp-table-prefixes/</guid><description>As a security tip you should always change the default table prefix &amp;quot;wp_&amp;quot;, mainly to avoid zero-day vulnerabilities (Vulnerabilities that haven't been discovered yet), or JavaScript SQL injection.
A very good tool you could use for that purpose is the WP-Security-Scan plugin, which takes care of all your security problems, including that one.
The problem is that most of the times it is very hard to get it to change the prefix.</description></item></channel></rss>
