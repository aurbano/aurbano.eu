&lt;p&gt;I wanted a simple setup, that stores my blog on Github and publishes updates automatically. Until now I had been using Jekyll but setting it up was usually non trivial, and things keps breaking over time.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;So this time I migrated the blog to Hugo, redesigned a template, and set up Github Actions to publish it automatically. I can now use Github&amp;rsquo;s UI to write new posts if I&amp;rsquo;m on the go, and things seem way more stable!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>2016 Q1 Update</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2016-04-28-what-im-doing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2016-04-28-what-im-doing/</guid><description>&lt;h3 id="actions"&gt;Actions&lt;/h3&gt;
&lt;p&gt;This past year I invested heavily in Angularjs - building a massive application at work (at least it feels massive to me, the front end is at about 20k LOC without dependencies).&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;At some point I realised that JS wasn&amp;rsquo;t cutting it for &lt;em&gt;our size&lt;/em&gt;, Angularjs provided the tools to build, but &lt;strong&gt;not to maintain&lt;/strong&gt;. So I decided to refactor everything into &lt;strong&gt;Typescript&lt;/strong&gt;. Three weeks and many late nights later we had type safety, coding without messing things up was easy and fun again!&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Developing more intelligent algorithms</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-11-22-developing-more-intelligent-algorithms/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-11-22-developing-more-intelligent-algorithms/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;First of all, what do we call intelligence when talking about algorithms? Well, if we have an algorithm that is able to forecast when it is going to rain and when it will be sunny, we might call that intelligent, but it depends on some other variable, the time and effort it took for it to get those results. Thus the faster and lower number of variables our algorithm needs to return the same or even better results, the more intelligent it is.&lt;br&gt;
That is a rule of thumb, but how do we do that?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Stumble Upon Low Bounce Rate</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-09-14-stumble-upon-low-bounce-rate/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-09-14-stumble-upon-low-bounce-rate/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;This might seem strange, but the lowest bounce rate in my blog comes from Stumble Upon visitors. And this is not surprising, since I think that Stumble Upon is the most accurate way of getting your blog to your exact target audience.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="http://static.urbanoalvarez.es/img/blog/stumble_bounce_rate.gif" alt="Stumble Upon Bounce Rate"&gt;&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;For example in the picture above, from my Analytics reports for last month, Stumble Upon visitors' bounce rate is 47.45% less than the blog's average. Demonstrating the accurateness of its interest/channel system.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Google Chrome</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-09-02-google-chrome/</link><pubDate>Tue, 02 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-09-02-google-chrome/</guid><description>&lt;blockquote&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Well, it was time for web-giant Google to jump the gap between being the world leader in providing web-based services to actually providing&amp;hellip; the web.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Today Google launched the Beta version of &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/chrome/index.html?hl=es&amp;amp;brand=CHMG&amp;amp;utm_source=es-hpp&amp;amp;utm_medium=hpp&amp;amp;utm_campaign=es"&gt;Google Chrome&lt;/a&gt;, which will be the revolutionary browser nowadays, as Google claims. But what makes it so great? Well, Google announced in a &lt;a href="http://www.google.com/googlebooks/chrome/"&gt;very entertaining comic-book&lt;/a&gt; that it was going to provide a solution to every single problem in today's browsers, but is it true?&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Quantum Universe Simulation - The Unique beings paradox</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-05-20-quantum-universe-simulatio/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-05-20-quantum-universe-simulatio/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Completely off topic for this blog, but at the time it is the best place to write about this. Read through the whole thing before judging what you see, then think about it, and then express your opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-unique-beings-paradox"&gt;The Unique Beings paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start off I will check with you certain easy experiments that are the base of this. We both agree that the same set of variables, done in the same order in the same way must always produce the same result. An example of this is that if we had two identical containers full of the same amount of the same water, and using a machine we dropped two identical steel balls of the same mass in the same point of the containers and we recorded each from the same angle and the same lighting we would have exactly identical results in the water, each second of one would match exactly each second of the other, until the water flattened again.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
