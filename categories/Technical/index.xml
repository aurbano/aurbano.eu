If you have tried using the typical tools (iText for Java, ReportLab in Python&amp;hellip; ) you understand why it&amp;rsquo;s bad.
Imagine having to build a PDF like this:
Rectangle pagesize = new Rectangle(216f, 720f); Document document = new Document(pagesize, 36f, 72f, 108f, 180f); // step 2 PdfWriter.getInstance(document, new FileOutputStream(RESULT)); // step 3 document.open(); // step 4 document.add(new Paragraph( &amp;#34;Hello World!

I was developing a couple of front ends lately, and decided to put everything together and get a nice environment working. I basically wanted:
Dependency management (Bower) File injection (Requirejs) Both working nicely together (Grunt) MVC front end (Angularjs) It seems straight forward seeing the list this way, but it does take a while to get it running.</description></item><item><title>My Interesting Zsh Prompt</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2014-11-08-my-interesting-zsh-prompt/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2014-11-08-my-interesting-zsh-prompt/</guid><description>Yes, this is outdated - I&amp;rsquo;ve now moved on to use Oh My Zsh, mostly with the default setup to keep things simple.
I already did a post on the steps I took to set up my new macbook for development.
After that post I started using Zsh more and more, and came to realize how much better it could become with some tweaking.

Step 1 Setup, install Yosemite, open System Preferences and change everything.
Remove most things from the dock, change the theme to Dark.

But the actual goal would be for that element to be on top onFocus, and that means whenever the user clicks on the element.
Exploring the jqueryUI source code for the Draggable widget we can extract the function that puts the element on top of the stack and bind it onClick for example.</description></item><item><title>Perfect jQuery UI rotating tabs</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-10-20-perfect-jquery-ui-rotating-tabs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-10-20-perfect-jquery-ui-rotating-tabs/</guid><description>Tabs are nice. They create a very elegant interface, and jQuery UI does this marvelously.
How to do that? Include the files With jQuery and jQuery UI it is dead simple. First, load the libraries, I recommend using the hosted files at Google for jQuery:
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/files/jquery-x.min.js&amp;#34; type=&amp;#34;text/javascript&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;path/to/jquery UI&amp;#34; type=&amp;#34;text/javascript&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; Remember to include also the CSS files for the UI Theme! Otherwise the tabs won't seem to work!</description></item><item><title>Online radio - Setting it up &amp; hosting it</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-06-29-online-radio-setting-it-up-hosting-it/</link><pubDate>Mon, 29 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-06-29-online-radio-setting-it-up-hosting-it/</guid><description>Audio being broadcasted via the Internet. So that means that we generate an audio stream that listeners cannot control, other than pausing and resuming.
To launch one we need several things, to start off, we need a server with streaming capabilities. Since setting up a streaming server might be difficult, we will use a standard radio management program. The main ones are SHOUTcast, IceCast, Live365&amp;hellip;
I will focus on SHOUTcast, since it is the most extended among web hosts.</description></item><item><title>Event tracking - Google Analytics</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-06-13-event-tracking-google-analytics/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-06-13-event-tracking-google-analytics/</guid><description>What is event tracking? In simple terms, it logs events that happen on your site, for example rate a post (If you have post rating), download a file&amp;hellip; or you do some sort of JavaScript processing that you want to measure.
So finally, we can keep track of AJAX interactions with the server, we can log also normal POST requests that do some php processing, like posting a comment, or editing some data in our database.</description></item><item><title>Display time since last visit in PHP</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-01-20-display-time-since-last-visit-in-php/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-01-20-display-time-since-last-visit-in-php/</guid><description>This short snippet produces a &amp;ldquo;Twitter style&amp;rdquo; time difference, the idea is that it will round to the nearest time unit, and display only the integers on that unit. For example 1 minute ago, 2 weeks ago, 1 year ago&amp;hellip;
You can specify the word you want to appear instead of ago by setting the $ago argument to something else as well.
I moved this code to a Github Gist, available here:</description></item><item><title>Display previous/next posts in single or category in WordPress</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-09-14-display-previous-next-posts-wordpress/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-09-14-display-previous-next-posts-wordpress/</guid><description>This is a really good option in WordPress, yet very few know how to do it. Well the code is relatively simple, and it gives a good navigation point for users that, if they liked your article, might want to keep reading your stuff.
If you want to plainly display the next post after the one the user is reading, use the following function:
next_post_link(); Now this function has several (very useful) parameters, which are:</description></item><item><title>Use the browser to spell check your website</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-09-14-use-firefox-to-spell-check-your-website/</link><pubDate>Sun, 14 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-09-14-use-firefox-to-spell-check-your-website/</guid><description>If you maintain a website, you will surely know how important it is to never have any spelling errors in your copy. And if you really care you will always run for sure a spell checker on all your text, but isn't that quite over work? Wouldn't it be much simpler if your browser did all the spell checking without you having to worry about anything?
Spell check Drag this button to the bookmarks bar and you'll have it.</description></item><item><title>Bypass/Flash BIOS password:</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-09-12-bypassflash-bios-password/</link><pubDate>Fri, 12 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-09-12-bypassflash-bios-password/</guid><description>Have you ever tried to access a computer's BIOS settings to find they are protected? Or maybe it was you and forgot the password. Either way don't worry since bypassing this simple password is as simple as following the following solutions:
Solution 1 The simplest solution, although it may not work on some computers. This solution is called a keystroke backdoor, and it bypasses the password check (Meaning that you won't change it or get to know it)</description></item><item><title>Easily assign an image to a post in WordPress</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-09-11-assign-image-to-wordpress-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-09-11-assign-image-to-wordpress-post/</guid><description>Have you ever wondered how to assign an image to a certain post using WordPress? Surely there are some plugins that try to do this, and maybe they accomplish it, but probably slowing down your blog.
Well, here is a way of doing it without slowing the blog or installing any sort of additional plugins. When you are done writing your post, upload an image to a directory that you will use for this, for example: &amp;quot;www.</description></item><item><title>Best unobtrusive anti-spam technique (Not CAPTCHA)</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-08-23-best-unobtrusive-anti-spam-technique-not-captcha/</link><pubDate>Sat, 23 Aug 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-08-23-best-unobtrusive-anti-spam-technique-not-captcha/</guid><description>I know you are probably thinking that this will be some silly thing, but this idea that Thomas Landauer came up with is by far the best I've seen in a long time.
How does it work? Well the idea is relatively simple: Add CSS-hidden fields that a user won't see, but a spam-bot will fill. Then using php check if they were filled, and if they were: block the spammer!</description></item><item><title>Did you mean?

Si I started thinking for the easiest way to do this.
There are actually a lot of php functions out there to look for similar text. The most obvious one?
similar_text()
similar_text — Calculate the similarity between two strings
You must pass 2 parameters plus an optional third.</description></item><item><title>Get full domain from user's URL in php</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-05-28-get-full-domain-from-users-url-in-php/</link><pubDate>Wed, 28 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-05-28-get-full-domain-from-users-url-in-php/</guid><description>What I'm going to post here is a php function that will create a standard url from a user-inputted url so that any string will be converted to a functioning url.
First it will convert all characters to lowercase:
$url = strtolower($url); Now add http:// if it is not at the beggining:
if(strncasecmp(&amp;#39;http://&amp;#39;,$url,7) !== 0){ //There is no http:// at the beginning: $url = &amp;#39;http://&amp;#39;.$url; } What strncasecmp does is it takes a string, and then a number.</description></item><item><title>sIFR - Use custom fonts in your website safely</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-05-01-sirf/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-05-01-sirf/</guid><description>sIFR is probably one of the most amazing scripts I've seen lately. Developed by Mike Davidson and Mark Wubben, it allows you to change the fonts used in your website to custom fonts without having to worry about them in the user's computer.
How this is accomplished is actually &amp;ldquo;very simple&amp;rdquo;. First of all you need a folder with all your fonts (.ttf files), then a JavaScript file has to be called from your html pages which will first check if Flash is enabled, and then if it is it will read through the code and determine where it should insert the flash movies.</description></item><item><title>Changing WP Table prefixes</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-04-14-changing-wp-table-prefixes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-04-14-changing-wp-table-prefixes/</guid><description>As a security tip you should always change the default table prefix &amp;quot;wp_&amp;quot;, mainly to avoid zero-day vulnerabilities (Vulnerabilities that haven't been discovered yet), or JavaScript SQL injection.
A very good tool you could use for that purpose is the WP-Security-Scan plugin, which takes care of all your security problems, including that one.
The problem is that most of the times it is very hard to get it to change the prefix.</description></item><item><title>SEO Tool Search Engine position checker</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-04-06-search-engine-position/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-04-06-search-engine-position/</guid><description>Hello! Although this was a nice script back then, it is now very outdated. There are APIs available now that weren&amp;rsquo;t at the moment, so I decided to remove the post.
