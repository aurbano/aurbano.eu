No complications, just that.
Then the isolation came, bringing with it a ton of free time and an even better reason to make this - people would be bored at home!
So we set out to make it, I managed to convince a couple of friends to give me a hand with this: @prhcummins and @jaicab and off we went.</description></item><item><title>Flocking Behaviour Simulations</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2020-02-15-flocking-simulation/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2020-02-15-flocking-simulation/</guid><description>This post details my journey learning about flocking behaviours, the mathematical models behind them, and my own implementation using WebGL. You can also see the final product before you read it if you want!
I&amp;rsquo;ve always been fascinated by flocks of birds flying in the sky creating patterns like the ones you can see in this video:

It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like simplified Age of Empires, where you write the code that drives a bunch of ants, and they need to survive and ultimately be the only ones alive in the map.
We needed to generate map procedurally, which is nothing new really, but it was new to me when I started writing the code for it, so it&amp;rsquo;s been a fun opportunity to learn something new!</description></item><item><title>When do you fix bugs?</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2020-02-04-prioritizing-bugs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 04 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2020-02-04-prioritizing-bugs/</guid><description>At work we have a decently sized pile of bugs in our backlog. Most of them are not business impacting or critical, so they just sit there.
Unfortunately we&amp;rsquo;ve never had a process to handle bugs consistently - until now!
This may seem obvious to some, and others will probably have an even better system - I&amp;rsquo;d love to hear from you if that&amp;rsquo;s the case!
Our new process There are two parts to it:</description></item><item><title>I am my family's password manager</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2019-12-18-i-am-my-familys-password-manager/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2019-12-18-i-am-my-familys-password-manager/</guid><description>I wrote this right after a phone call from my mum, asking me for her gmail password. Which she set herself last time I was with them (because she couldn&amp;rsquo;t remember the previous one). So I saved it in my password manager just in case&amp;hellip;
They basically have all sessions logged in on their phones and computers, and use &amp;ldquo;Forgot my password&amp;rdquo; whenever they actually need to login to anything. Because of that they end up choosing some random new password for each service every time that happens, and obviously forget it the next time they need it.</description></item><item><title>Journey into Haskell</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2019-12-18-journey-into-haskell/</link><pubDate>Wed, 18 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2019-12-18-journey-into-haskell/</guid><description>I just came across a great read called &amp;ldquo;The one time I thought I understood recursion&amp;rdquo;, which talked about a developer&amp;rsquo;s first steps with Haskell.
He&amp;rsquo;s doing the classic &amp;ldquo;find the n-th prime&amp;rdquo; algorithm, that has a typical recursive solution. It includes a snippet that solves the problem in a way that&amp;rsquo;s just as beautiful as it is impossible to understand for me right now, without any Haskell knowledge.
So I&amp;rsquo;ve decided to (finally) start my Journey into Haskell by understanding how that snippet works.</description></item><item><title>2019 Q4 Update</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2019-12-14-another-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2019-12-14-another-update/</guid><description>After putting this aside for a few years (3 apparently&amp;hellip; ) I finally decided to spend a weekend bringing my personal website back to life.
I wanted a simple setup, that stores my blog on Github and publishes updates automatically. Until now I had been using Jekyll but setting it up was usually non trivial, and things keps breaking over time.
So this time I migrated the blog to Hugo, redesigned a template, and set up Github Actions to publish it automatically.</description></item><item><title>Generating Pixel Perfect PDF Reports</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2016-06-21-generating-pdf-reports/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Jun 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2016-06-21-generating-pdf-reports/</guid><description>Have you been tasked with generating PDF reports? If you have tried using the typical tools (iText for Java, ReportLab in Python&amp;hellip; ) you understand why it&amp;rsquo;s bad.

At some point I realised that JS wasn&amp;rsquo;t cutting it for our size, Angularjs provided the tools to build, but not to maintain. So I decided to refactor everything into Typescript. Three weeks and many late nights later we had type safety, coding without messing things up was easy and fun again!</description></item><item><title>Using the latest front-end tech</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2015-03-03-front-end-sample/</link><pubDate>Tue, 03 Mar 2015 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2015-03-03-front-end-sample/</guid><description>There are so many new technologies popping up every week on JavaScript front end ways of doing things that it becomes really hard to stay on top of everything.
I was developing a couple of front ends lately, and decided to put everything together and get a nice environment working. I basically wanted:
Dependency management (Bower) File injection (Requirejs) Both working nicely together (Grunt) MVC front end (Angularjs) It seems straight forward seeing the list this way, but it does take a while to get it running.</description></item><item><title>My Interesting Zsh Prompt</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2014-11-08-my-interesting-zsh-prompt/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Nov 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2014-11-08-my-interesting-zsh-prompt/</guid><description>Yes, this is outdated - I&amp;rsquo;ve now moved on to use Oh My Zsh, mostly with the default setup to keep things simple.
I already did a post on the steps I took to set up my new macbook for development.
After that post I started using Zsh more and more, and came to realize how much better it could become with some tweaking.

Step 1 Setup, install Yosemite, open System Preferences and change everything.
Remove most things from the dock, change the theme to Dark.
Play with the trackpad gestures, didn&amp;rsquo;t understand the reason for the dashboard.

The new kit has shorter arms that are also hollow, so the ESC cables will be able to go through them. It also comes with a 3d printed yaw mechanism, which works much better with the servo to provide a smoother turning system.</description></item><item><title>Mac: Shanghai to Spain</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2014-10-21-mac-shanghai-to-spain/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2014-10-21-mac-shanghai-to-spain/</guid><description>I just ordered a new Macbook Air, exactly when the October 16th Keynote was over (In case they presented a new one with retina display).
So now I can only wait for it to arrive, quite excited about this, since it means getting new technology I&amp;rsquo;m not used to. It&amp;rsquo;s a pity they don&amp;rsquo;t offer express shipping, UPS takes 7 days to get it to Spain.
In order to make the wait less painful I did a quick script to parse the UPS tracking page and draw the locations on Scribble Maps:</description></item><item><title>Making of Nebula text</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2014-10-21-making-of-nebula-text/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2014-10-21-making-of-nebula-text/</guid><description>When I was doing the Tree Generator, I used dat.gui for the first time, and on their workshop they have the following text to play with:
dat.gui - This gave me the idea to render text on the canvas using particles that would seem to be gravitating around, in such a way that when seen all together you would see the text.
Example: &amp;ldquo;hey&amp;rdquo; Click for explosions For this example I set a big drag force so that the particles would settle fast and you could read the text more easily.</description></item><item><title>Web Visualizer using WebGL</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2014-10-10-web-visualizer-using-webgl/</link><pubDate>Fri, 10 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2014-10-10-web-visualizer-using-webgl/</guid><description>I decided to build a tool that would allow me to see how websites are related in a visual way. I&amp;rsquo;m still working on the concept but the tool is ready and working: WebVisualizer.
Building blocks In order to get this to work there were some basic building blocks I needed. Some server side and a few client side. Here is a little run through:

I decided to use that to create a game and learn about game development all together.

He actually has a really cool blog where he writes about his projects, and used to work at FliteTest.
I started my plan with a Word document where I wrote all I could find on tricopters, fpv, parts&amp;hellip; etc, so that when I actually decided to start I would be ready, my original list looked like this:</description></item><item><title>jQueryUI Draggable: Bring stack element to front on click</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2013-01-21-jqueryui-draggable-bring-stack-element-to-front-on-click/</link><pubDate>Mon, 21 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2013-01-21-jqueryui-draggable-bring-stack-element-to-front-on-click/</guid><description>If you are developing window-like elements on HTML using jQueryUI Draggable, you are probably using the stack option to ensure that the dragged element will always be on top. But the actual goal would be for that element to be on top onFocus, and that means whenever the user clicks on the element.
Exploring the jqueryUI source code for the Draggable widget we can extract the function that puts the element on top of the stack and bind it onClick for example.</description></item><item><title>Procedurally generated trees in JavaScript</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2013-01-14-procedurally-generated-trees-in-javascript/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Jan 2013 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2013-01-14-procedurally-generated-trees-in-javascript/</guid><description>Over the past year I've been more and more interested in HTML5 canvas, since it allows very fast development of graphical animations using JavaScript.
Another thing that has always amazed me was procedurally generated content. Check out Steven Wittens' &amp;quot;Making worlds&amp;quot;, a wonderful article on generating planets from orbit to aerial zoom.
So I decided to create a 2D tree generator in JavaScript, you can take a look at it to know exactly what I am talking about.</description></item><item><title>Developing more intelligent algorithms</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-11-22-developing-more-intelligent-algorithms/</link><pubDate>Sun, 22 Nov 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-11-22-developing-more-intelligent-algorithms/</guid><description>First of all, what do we call intelligence when talking about algorithms? Well, if we have an algorithm that is able to forecast when it is going to rain and when it will be sunny, we might call that intelligent, but it depends on some other variable, the time and effort it took for it to get those results. Thus the faster and lower number of variables our algorithm needs to return the same or even better results, the more intelligent it is.</description></item><item><title>Perfect jQuery UI rotating tabs</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-10-20-perfect-jquery-ui-rotating-tabs/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Oct 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-10-20-perfect-jquery-ui-rotating-tabs/</guid><description>Tabs are nice. They create a very elegant interface, and jQuery UI does this marvelously.
How to do that? Include the files With jQuery and jQuery UI it is dead simple. First, load the libraries, I recommend using the hosted files at Google for jQuery:
&amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;http://jqueryjs.googlecode.com/files/jquery-x.min.js&amp;#34; type=&amp;#34;text/javascript&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; &amp;lt;script src=&amp;#34;path/to/jquery UI&amp;#34; type=&amp;#34;text/javascript&amp;#34;&amp;gt;&amp;lt;/script&amp;gt; Remember to include also the CSS files for the UI Theme!

So that means that we generate an audio stream that listeners cannot control, other than pausing and resuming.
To launch one we need several things, to start off, we need a server with streaming capabilities. Since setting up a streaming server might be difficult, we will use a standard radio management program. The main ones are SHOUTcast, IceCast, Live365&amp;hellip;
I will focus on SHOUTcast, since it is the most extended among web hosts.</description></item><item><title>Event tracking - Google Analytics</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-06-13-event-tracking-google-analytics/</link><pubDate>Sat, 13 Jun 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-06-13-event-tracking-google-analytics/</guid><description>What is event tracking? In simple terms, it logs events that happen on your site, for example rate a post (If you have post rating), download a file&amp;hellip; or you do some sort of JavaScript processing that you want to measure.
So finally, we can keep track of AJAX interactions with the server, we can log also normal POST requests that do some php processing, like posting a comment, or editing some data in our database.</description></item><item><title>Display time since last visit in PHP</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-01-20-display-time-since-last-visit-in-php/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 Jan 2009 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2009-01-20-display-time-since-last-visit-in-php/</guid><description>This short snippet produces a &amp;ldquo;Twitter style&amp;rdquo; time difference, the idea is that it will round to the nearest time unit, and display only the integers on that unit.

if(strncasecmp(&amp;#39;http://&amp;#39;,$url,7) !== 0){ //There is no http:// at the beginning: $url = &amp;#39;http://&amp;#39;.$url; } What strncasecmp does is it takes a string, and then a number.</description></item><item><title>Quantum Universe Simulation - The Unique beings paradox</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-05-20-quantum-universe-simulatio/</link><pubDate>Tue, 20 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-05-20-quantum-universe-simulatio/</guid><description>Completely off topic for this blog, but at the time it is the best place to write about this. Read through the whole thing before judging what you see, then think about it, and then express your opinion.
The Unique Beings paradox To start off I will check with you certain easy experiments that are the base of this. We both agree that the same set of variables, done in the same order in the same way must always produce the same result.</description></item><item><title>sIFR - Use custom fonts in your website safely</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-05-01-sirf/</link><pubDate>Thu, 01 May 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-05-01-sirf/</guid><description>sIFR is probably one of the most amazing scripts I've seen lately. Developed by Mike Davidson and Mark Wubben, it allows you to change the fonts used in your website to custom fonts without having to worry about them in the user's computer.
How this is accomplished is actually &amp;ldquo;very simple&amp;rdquo;. First of all you need a folder with all your fonts (.ttf files), then a JavaScript file has to be called from your html pages which will first check if Flash is enabled, and then if it is it will read through the code and determine where it should insert the flash movies.</description></item><item><title>Changing WP Table prefixes</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-04-14-changing-wp-table-prefixes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-04-14-changing-wp-table-prefixes/</guid><description>As a security tip you should always change the default table prefix &amp;quot;wp_&amp;quot;, mainly to avoid zero-day vulnerabilities (Vulnerabilities that haven't been discovered yet), or JavaScript SQL injection.
A very good tool you could use for that purpose is the WP-Security-Scan plugin, which takes care of all your security problems, including that one.
The problem is that most of the times it is very hard to get it to change the prefix.</description></item><item><title>SEO Tool Search Engine position checker</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-04-06-search-engine-position/</link><pubDate>Sun, 06 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-04-06-search-engine-position/</guid><description>Hello! Although this was a nice script back then, it is now very outdated. There are APIs available now that weren&amp;rsquo;t at the moment, so I decided to remove the post.
It basically sent GET requests via cURL in PHP to Google, and then parsed the response looking for your website. It was kind of usefull to see &amp;ldquo;quickly&amp;rdquo; how well your website ranked for several keywords.</description></item><item><title>About me</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/about/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/about/</guid><description>My name is Alejandro U.

Also a chat, forum, and many other sections that users discover over time.
This was mostly done to experiment with some new programming concepts, but it got quite popular in Spain so I kept on working on it for several years, making a few good friends in the community that it formed :)
The chat was the main feature, and some people kept coming back for some reason, eventually forming a very tight community.</description></item><item><title>CloudClient</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2012-cloudclient/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2012-cloudclient/</guid><description>An experiment integrating an API with JavaScript. It&amp;rsquo;s fully open source if you want to take a look.
Back then I was in uni and saw that Dropbox offered some very cool internships, so I built this in the hopes that it would help get one (it didn&amp;rsquo;t :( ) I also though I could create an amazing interface for cloud storage services, trying to make the web app look like the Windows explorer.</description></item><item><title>DJs Music</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2007-djsmusic/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2007-djsmusic/</guid><description>Music sharing website where independent DJs upload their mixes and original songs, packed with features developed over the years.
The site is now translated in 5 languages, and is popular in many different countries (although most notably in India).
Google decided one day that I was braching the AdSense ToS without an explanation so I could no longer monetize it&amp;hellip; This was a tough blow for my motivation because I had managed a steady 500$/month as a teenager with it and suddenly it was gone.</description></item><item><title>dotdot</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2020-dotdot/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2020-dotdot/</guid><description>Online community where people come and chat to each other. We ensure that chat groups are around 10 people, and try to make it so that when you come back you end up with a mix of people you already chatted with, and some new people.

I&amp;rsquo;ve always been interested in image manipulation, so I decided to build this. It does image processing using convolution matrices and some creative canvas tricks.
It&amp;rsquo;s a mix of two different libraries, all created from scratch for this project: a GUI controller and an image editing library.</description></item><item><title>QuePiensas</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2011-quepiensas/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2011-quepiensas/</guid><description>Spanish (failed) social network fully integrated with Facebook. It alows users to express their opinion on their friends. I&amp;rsquo;m still sure that this idea can become popular, it&amp;rsquo;s just that we didn&amp;rsquo;t achieve the right user experience. Building everything from scratch was a serious effort that helped us learn a lot, but made development too slow. We had no reusable CSS or components, no MVC architecture, nothing really&amp;hellip;
At some point I will surely give it another go, although this time as an app, they have far more potential I think.</description></item><item><title>Search Results</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/search/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/search/</guid><description/></item><item><title>socialgorithm</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2017-socialgorithm/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2017-socialgorithm/</guid><description>Online community and platform for code workshops and challenges.

We provide all the technology + experienced mentors from the industry to our events. Students come to the events from local universities thanks to the support of our partner student-led tech societies.
Our first Workshop was Ultimate Tic Tac Toe, which works really well for a 1 day event. The ideal solution involves a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm so it allows students to practice some pretty cool programming.</description></item><item><title>VayaCoñazo</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2013-vayaconazo/</link><pubDate>Mon, 01 Jan 0001 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/projects/2013-vayaconazo/</guid><description>An entertainment site, mixing an RSS aggregator and a &amp;ldquo;rage comic&amp;rdquo; site where users submit their content. It pulls content from its own database and a lot other sources, combining everything on the same feed.
There is also a video viewer that displays the latest videos in a nice AJAX interface, I actually used the video viewer quite more often than the actual site, it&amp;rsquo;s a nice way to spend 10 minutes.</description></item></channel></rss>
