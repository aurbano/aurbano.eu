So I decided to refactor everything into <strong>Typescript</strong>. Three weeks and many late nights later we had type safety, coding without messing things up was easy and fun again!</p><h3 id=thoughts>Thoughts</h3><p>Around May I started a new side project (as usual) and wanted to choose the best possible stack (as always). <strong>Angular2</strong> would've been awesome, but <strong>React</strong> seems to be the &ldquo;winning framework&rdquo; now, and learning is always a plus right?</p><p>On to the server side: Java is what we've been using at our work project, it's reliable and everyone knows it. &ldquo;But NodeJS!!&rdquo; some people would be screaming right now - yeah, I love it as well, but I wouldn't build (at the moment) a massive system with it. Maybe with Typescript&mldr; But no, I prefer the safety of mind I get when building a Java/Scala backend.</p><p>And then I came across this in HN last night: <a href=https://github.com/calebmer/postgraphql>Postgraphql</a> - a project that sets up a Graphql server on top of Postgres! Seriously, I thought REST was <strong>the coolest kid on the block</strong>, but read a bit of Graphql's docs.</p><blockquote><p>Because of multiple round-trips and over-fetching, applications built in the REST style inevitably end up building ad hoc endpoints that are superficially in the REST style. These actually couple the data to a particular view which explicitly violates one of REST's major goals. Most REST systems of any complexity end up as a continuum of endpoints that span from “traditional” REST to ad hoc endpoints.
<em>&ndash; GraphQL docs</em></p></blockquote><p>Having <strong>the client</strong> decide which data, which format, and what <strong>combinations</strong> (JOINS) to do with it, just makes <strong>maintainability</strong> insanely easy! (And having an easy to maintain project <strong>is</strong> the best thing, way better than sliced bread)</p><p>I haven't used it extensively, so maybe its implementations are flawed, but the <em>idea</em> is brilliant. And that's what I care for right now. People are awesome and pull requests will fix the issues, but <strong>the base ideas aren't fixable</strong>. So yeah, good luck documenting your REST API automatically&mldr; (including authentication/authorisation, request/response formats, flows of requests, you get it)</p><h3 id=and-the-point-is>And the point is?</h3><p>No idea, probably that I wish everyone would just stop <em>creating</em> new frameworks and workflows for a second, so that we could all just step back, look at the mess we've done, and come up with <strong>the actual, good solution</strong>. But now I have to quote XKCD&mldr;</p><p><img src=http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/standards.png alt=XKCD></p><p>At the same time I love the feeling of &ldquo;mind blown&rdquo; that you get when reading how <strong>the new</strong> framework does things, and it's so obvious it's better that you just don't understand what the hell we were thinking before!</p><p>Maybe the whole point of this blog will be to write about what excites me, twice a year or so, so that I can look back later on and realise how stupid hypes are&mldr;</p></div></div></div></div></main><footer><p class="copyright text-muted">© All rights reserved.</p></footer><div class="border animated-hue"></div></body></html>
