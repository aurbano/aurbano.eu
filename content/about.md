My name is Alejandro U. Alvarez and I'm a passionate developer interested in web development, security, realtime/collaborative applications and tons of other stuff.

I'm currently located in London working as a dev manager in a security team at an investment bank.

I can be contacted via any of the social links at the top right, or via email at aluralma at gmail.

## I create things

That sums up my main interest, I like making things. It tends to be software, but I do electronics, make music, websites... new ideas in general.

I also love **learning** different things, I read as much as possible for that, and keep on throwing myself into things I know nothing about - which sometimes works well and mostly doesn't!

My software things are divided between [projects](/projects), [libraries](https://github.com/aurbano), and [little experiments](/labs). I used to develop one large personal project a year, but that proves very time consuming and ultimately not that useful.

So I focus more on libraries and experiments now (not that those are a lot more useful, but I'm able to get more things done this way).

I really enjoy making music, skiing, [radio controlled](/categories/RC/) machines, and travelling around.
