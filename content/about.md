title: About me
---

My name is Alejandro U. Alvarez and I'm a passionate developer interested in full stack development, ML/AI, security, realtime/collaborative applications and tons of other stuff. I live in London, and work as a product engineer at [Wise](https://wise.com).

I like making things. It tends to be software, but I also enjoy working on [electronics](/categories/RC/), making music, building stuff with wood (converted my own camper van...!) anything really!

These last couple of years I've decided to focus mostly in deep learning, AI... as that has been my biggest interest since I was a kid. I joined an MSc on AI, and through the [education tech company](https://socialgorithm.org) I started with my friend [Bharat Reddy](https://bharatreddy.com/) we've developed some workshops and competitions that involve AI (more on this soon!) to enable us to practice more and meet people in the field.

I also love [learning](http://localhost:1313/categories/Learning/) different things, I read as much as possible for that, and keep on throwing myself into things I know nothing about - which sometimes works well and mostly doesn't!
