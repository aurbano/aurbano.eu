Online community and platform for code workshops and challenges. Used by universities and companies to run events for students, interns, employees...

We provide all the technology + experienced mentors from the industry to our events. Students come to the events from local universities thanks to the support of our partner student-led tech societies. 

Our first Workshop was [Ultimate Tic Tac Toe](https://socialgorithm.org/docs/sections/participate/ultimate-tic-tac-toe/), which works really well for a 1 day event. The ideal solution involves a Monte Carlo Tree Search algorithm so it allows students to practice some pretty cool programming.

We're also working on a **Self Driving car race** and a **Bee Hive simulation** game, both aiming at allowing students to practice Deep Learning solutions.
