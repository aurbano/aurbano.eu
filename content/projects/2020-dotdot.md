[Currently offline - will be back up soon though]

Online community where people come and chat to each other. We ensure that chat groups are around 10 people, and try to make it so that when you come back you end up with a mix of people you already chatted with, and some new people.

More about it on the [launch blog post](/post/2020-04-13-dotdot/) :)

Great project to practice React and Socket.IO.
