    An entertainment site, mixing an RSS aggregator and a "rage comic" site where users submit their content. It pulls content from its own database and a lot other sources, combining everything on the same feed.

    There is also a video viewer that displays the latest videos in a nice AJAX interface, I actually use the video viewer quite more often than the actual site, it's a nice way to spend 10 minutes. Every single video that ever goes viral or becomes famous appears on this viewer some time before. I'm also planning on making an app for it.
