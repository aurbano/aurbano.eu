title: CloudClient
description: > 
    An experiment integrating an API with JavaScript. It's fully open source if you want to take a look. I would love to have more time and do the whole thing again, perhaps one day. The goal with this was to practice some JavaScript, and also because I though I could do an amazing interface for cloud storage services. I did learn a lot of JavaScript, while failing to do an amazing interface. I might revisit it at some point and try to improve it a bit.

    The full source code can be found on Github, there might be some useful parts.
