An experiment integrating an API with JavaScript. It's fully open source if you want to take a look.

Back then I was in uni and saw that Dropbox offered some very cool internships, so I built this in the hopes that it would help get one (it didn't :( ) I also though I could create an amazing interface for cloud storage services, trying to make the web app look like the Windows explorer.

I did learn a lot of JavaScript, while failing to do an amazing interface. But thanks to this project I learned to setup OAuth, integrate with a fairly complex REST API and expose a fake "file system" API in PHP so that my frontend could look like it was an actual file explorer.

The full source code can be found on Github, there might be some useful parts.
