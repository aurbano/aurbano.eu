I just ordered a new Macbook Air, exactly when the October 16<sup>th</sup> Keynote was over (In case they presented a new one with retina display).

So now I can only wait for it to arrive, quite excited about this, since it means getting new technology I'm not used to. It's a pity they don't offer express shipping, UPS takes 7 days to get it to Spain.

In order to make the wait less painful I did a quick script to parse the UPS tracking page and draw the locations on Scribble Maps:

    <iframe width="100%" height="400" frameborder="0" src="//widgets.scribblemaps.com/sm/?d=true&lat=43.96557893761193&lng=55.87459875000002&z=true&l=true&mc=true&vz=3&type=road&width=550&height=400&id=aurbanoMac" style="border:0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
</figure>

When it arrives I might write a little post about migrating from Win to Mac with no experience on the latter.
