Well, it was time for web-giant Google to jump the gap between being the world leader in providing web-based services to actually providing... the web.

Today Google launched the Beta version of [Google Chrome][2], which will be the revolutionary browser nowadays, as Google claims. But what makes it so great? Well, Google announced in a [very entertaining comic-book][3] that it was going to provide a solution to every single problem in today\'s browsers, but is it true?

I am actually writing this post from Google Chrome, to test it out, and I have to say that it is impressive, fast, smart... and a very long list of good things, although it is not as intuitive as I would like it to be. We are used to browsers like Firefox, Safari... and others that share a basic layout and style that Chrome has overthrown completely. Suddenly there are no \"File\", \"Edit\", \"View\" and all the usual windows tabs, there are almost no configuration options, but there is simplicity and ease instead, which combined find the perfect balance.

The main drawback though is the lack of Extensions or plugins. I miss Stumbling Upon the web, my Firebug, and other small things that add up to a lot... Although I guess It\'ll be just a matter of time until they develop the extension system and main developers prepare the \"Chrome\" version of the add-ons.

My rating, if I was faced from a 0-10 choice would be around a 7. But the lack of plugins will never allow it for more. Maybe a normal user will find it perfect, but a developer and a user that spends hours a day watching for new stuff all over the web needs more than \"The basics\".

### 2013 Update

Interesting to see my opinion at launch. I currently use Chrome on a daily basis, it offers an incredible developer console, and grew to have a very comprehensive addon collection.
I'll come back in a few more years.

### 2019 Update

And we've come full circle again... I'm using Firefox now. I stayed with Google Chrome until 2018, mainly because it's dev-tools were amazing. Then Google started doing some funky things around privacy, like [logging you into Google services if you were logged into the browser](https://www.theverge.com/2018/9/24/17895536/google-chrome-69-log-in-sync-password-user-data-privacy). 

Firefox is now good enough to make the jump. I feel like it consumes more resources and battery, but I don't have any data to back that up. The dev-tools are *almost* as good as Chrome's (they miss little details, <del>like WebSockets support</del> I just realised they now support WebSockets experimentally) but for the most part they are good, it *is* a good browser.

But the main thing is the privacy. I run [Firefox Developer Edition](https://www.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/developer/) with the [Multi-Account Containers](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/multi-account-containers/) + [Cookie AutoDelete](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/cookie-autodelete/?src=search) extensions, and it's just perfect for me.

### 2023 Update

Heh, another full circle? I am back to using Chrome.

I did love the containers, it was nice having the same website using different profiles on the same window - but it was a bit slow and the dev tools didn't feel as refined.

So I switched back to Chrome, and used the profiles to segregate logins (work, personal, other). It's per-window instead per-tab, but it's better than nothing and it works for me.
