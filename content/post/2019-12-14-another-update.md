title: 2019 Q4 Update

After putting this aside for a few years (3 apparently... ) I finally decided to spend a weekend bringing my personal website back to life.

I wanted a simple setup, that stores my blog on Github and publishes updates automatically. Until now I had been using Jekyll but setting it up was usually non trivial, and things keps breaking over time.

So this time I migrated the blog to Hugo, redesigned a template, and set up Github Actions to publish it automatically. I can now use Github's UI to write new posts if I'm on the go, and things seem way more stable!

## Actions

Since my [last update](/note/2016-04-28-what-im-doing/) I've focused heavily on React, building several large side-projects. (I'll talk about them here very soon). I'm starting to feel like I'm reaching a very nice setup for frontend web apps.

I want to get back into blogging, I used to enjoy writing about little tricks I discovered, good ideas I had... Even if few people read them it's actually nice to be able to look back and see the stuff I was working on.

Maybe I could force myself to write something once a week, at least. Even if it's just to talk about whatever I learned that week.

## Thoughts

My idea for my next blog post is to talk about combining Jest Snapshot testing with a tool to tell you when your docs are out of date. I'm not 100% sure how that would work yet, but it seems like it would allow documentation for React websites to be kept in sync with them.

I'd also like to talk about AI, I've read Life 3.0 by Max Tegmark recently and I can't stop thinking about it. So hopefully I'll start experimenting with it soon. I'd like to find a way to publish it online though, maybe WASM, WebGL rendering... we'll see!
