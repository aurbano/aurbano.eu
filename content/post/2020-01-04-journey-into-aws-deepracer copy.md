I'm starting another learning journey, this time into [AWS DeepRacer](https://aws.amazon.com/deepracer/). I will continue updating this post as I go.

I started by installing Ubuntu on my gaming PC, and then following the steps on setting up locally to train. It seems to have worked, but in the process of setting up NVidia CUDA my `apt` "index" got corrupted (still not sure what's going on), so I'm debugging that issue now. Might have to reinstall Ubuntu (*sigh... Linux*).
