Github just started giving out "[Student packs](https://education.github.com/pack)", which include quite a big list of gifts, including a 1 year license of Unreal Engine. I decided to use that to create a game and learn about game development all together.

##Step 1

At first I decided to take a look at sample games, to get an idea of the project structure. It comes with a bootstrap for most types of games, so I started with a FPS one.

The first thing you realize when starting from nothing is: **This is hard**.

##Step 2
Going through a demo until I undestand it is going to be hard. I normally learn that way but there simply are too many new things. So, new approach:

They apparently have a lot of [YouTube playlists](https://www.youtube.com/user/UnrealDevelopmentKit/playlists) teaching how to do virtually everything. So I'll start there. But if I want to structure my learning I need goals.

Forget about creating a game for now, my milestone will be to create a realistic terrain generator. In order to get there I need to learn how to create a terrain first, so I have some basics now:

* Create a realistic terrain generator
    1. Learn how to create a terrain

I'll keep updating this post as I progress :)
