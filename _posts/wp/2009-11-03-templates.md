![Flash Mint][1]I was building a site for a relative new company a couple weeks ago, and they wanted “A professional looking, brilliant display” for their products, I know Flash, and can do decent stuff with it, but seriously, how long does it take to do something really cool?

So I headed to the only place where I know this can be found for sure, [Flash Mint][2], it was right then when I realized how much I had grown accustomed to it, the ease of use and friendliness of the design, and always full of new stuff!

You can even customize the products, get full website designs, and many [flash templates][3] for almost anything (Along with HTML, CSS, WordPress themes… etc) the list looks almost endless haha

Not so long ago I even bought a WordPress theme for a client I didn’t have enough time to spend on. He was looking for something like that and I told him I could offer him a better price if he bought a pre-made template, so I showed him the ones that best fit his description and he ended up getting the “[Personal Blog Theme][4]“, which looked really nice and fitted my client perfectly,

So if you are in a rush, or simply need a professional-looking Flash Movie, Template, or anything of the sort, this is a great alternative!
