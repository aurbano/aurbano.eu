Some of you might already have heard of my plugin, [Custom Fonts][1], and others might even have tried it. Well, after many feature requests and many hours of development the next major release (version 3) is almost ready to be made public, here is a screenshot:

[Custom fonts plugin - version 3][3]

As you can see, the design has been greatly improved, while still using tabbed interface. Here I will detail the new features:

*   It uses the latest version of sIFR (3) and all of the new capabilities it offers
*   Improved version check at the configuration check
*   One-click CSS selector management, with the ability to see all available selectors
*   JS color picker for ease of use, plus color preview in the Current blocks menu (See screenshot)
*   Improved generation algorithms to speed up the process.
*   Many other minor adjustments that improve small things in the plugin
