Well, after a while with this new design I felt the urge to redesign the whole thing. I am not changing the style, I’m quite comfortable with this idea of header / sidebar / footer style and I won’t try to reinvent the wheel…

I will still go into “Grunge” kind of artwork and style, but it will be much more visual and colorful than the current. The header and footer won’t be liquid, and the center will be liquid only up to 1000px, to avoid problems with huge Macs or things like that.  
Here is a preview of the design (Already coded):

If you have any suggestions/comments I would love to hear them, thanks!
