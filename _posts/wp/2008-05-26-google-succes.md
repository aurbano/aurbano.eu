Group of research finds out why Google has achieved such a level of popularity. Precisely his advertising tool “[Google Adsense][1]“.

Apparently Google “blackmails” all the websites out there with a medium popularity so that they’ll use their ad program. Whenever it finds a website running another advertising program they’ll set their PR to 0.  
And this is taking place specially among bloggers (You are reading a live example of it), using advertising programs that I won’t mention here (I’m trying to get my PR back :S )Ted Murphy said,

> “Once again Google has proved that PR has little to do with blog traffic, influence or relevance and everything to defending their monopolistic stranglehold on search and online advertising”

There are thousands of blogs out there whose PR has been taken away by Google ([Starryskye][2], mine, [AndyBeard  
][3]… ) And this are just examples of people who have told me about it.

You might say that Google is doing it because “buying links” is forbidden, but that why don’t they take away the PR of well known blogs like [TechCrunch][4], they too have [sponsored posts][5].

This is simply proving that Google’s PR has degenerated into a tool for them to control the public, as they can use the power it gives them to undermine any other advertising business without any chance for them to answer!  
There are already many options out there being developed to substitute Google’s PR. Obviously all these advertising websites need to develop them since they pay according to the PR of the blog. In this field we can be sure that new PR systems will be developed, but what happens now with our search positioning?  
Will we be affected by this decision? I can’t even ask anyone to exchange links with my blog since I have a PR of cero, when I used to have 2…

I am asking all of you to blog about this, digg it, make the world know about this outrageous strategy by Internet’s giant Google. We might not be as powerful as Google is, but if we make this issue known through out Internet I bet they’ll have to change.
