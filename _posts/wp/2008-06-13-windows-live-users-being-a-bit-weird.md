I use for my blog statistics both StatPress and Google Analytics, since both offer different things, and I was checking my referrers to see what do people search to get to my blog, to optimize my text and keywords to rank higher for those keywords, when I found a very strange thing:  
Google users usually use relatively “complex” search queries, like the following:

> round corners design js

> how to make a php mirc bot

And that is (I think) the normal thing to do when you are searching right? So then I find that about 0.13% of the total number of visits come from Windows Live, although it is still a pretty high number. And I then in Google Analytics checked to see what were the keywords they were using, and it turns out that about 99% of the people that use Windows Live Search use only ONE keyword!  
The arrive somehow to my site searching one word!:  
urbano

> little  
> easter  
> image  
> design  
> robots  
> …

These were the latest search keywords used, and I thought it might be a problem in the way StatPress and Google Analytics get the search query terms from the referrer URI, but when I did a long phrase search and clicked on my blog, the whole query appeared perfectly, so it is true that most Windows Live users really search one word…  
Unbelievable, if I had never seen it I would never have thought of it…
