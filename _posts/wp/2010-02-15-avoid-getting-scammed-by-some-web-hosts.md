Nowadays, whether it’s in the real or virtual world, scammers and thefts are just about anywhere. They are always waiting for a victim to take their bait. I wouldn’t even go explaining why there are such people as I’m pretty sure it would be an endless discussion. Just a simple question as why is it hard for them to exert an effort doing a decent or legal business rather than scamming people is already a mind boggling thing to figure out.

And now, they have indeed found another way to scam people and get money from their pockets. By offering free web hosting services, they can easily lure people to sign up and eventually charge them with hidden fees. To register for a free web hosting company is pretty much easy these days. Though there are still, of course, legit free web hosts, everyone should still be careful signing up with a hosting company.

To avoid ending up with the wrong hosting provider, it’s important that you take into consideration how long the company has been doing business. It’s often safer to go with hosts that have been providing their services at least for more than a year or two. Doteasy is a hosting company that also provides domain name registration service. They are currently one of the best that offer free web hosting and have been in the business for around 10 years now. They provide an ad free site and guarantee 99.9% uptime.
