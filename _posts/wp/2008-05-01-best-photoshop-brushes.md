I have decided to move my blog to Jekyll, [for several reasons](http://carlboettiger.info/2012/05/01/Jekyll-vs-Wordpress.html) and in the process of doing so I reviewed many of my older posts.

I ended up deleting many posts that I considered not to be good enough, although I left this message to avoid generating tons of 404s... 

The files available on this post were on MegaUpload, so yeah...
