![WebDesign DIY][1] 
I\'ve recently found out that I\'ve committed the design error I hate the most in the world. I\'ve thought as I was doing my first design in paper \"I\'ll put ... right here, as it is now done\". And I must say, this is the greatest brick wall for a designer, where many get stuck among the *others*, that humongous group formed by all the mediocre designers out there that do stuff the way it is supposed to do, the group of web designers who think that being original is \"putting that cool badge in the header\" or adding an \"accordion menu\" in their sites...

And of course I\'m not saying that an accordion menu is not a good navigation element, which could be perfectly discussed it that were the current topic, or that having the *Web 2.0 badge* is not appropriate, and I\'m sure that if you as a reader are not understanding it is probably because you have fallen for this common errors.

The solution: The simplest thing possibly, let your *inner designer* go, free yourself from conventional constraints that diminish your ability to create great sites, original layouts, CSS innovative techniques... After all, you don\'t need to be a Guru to create high quality things, you only need to use your unique understanding of the world, of the design fashion, and the site\'s personality to develop the final design.

Following this philosophy I\'ve been experimenting with this blog\'s design, and my main website\'s design, without arriving at a result I actually *enjoy*. Many ideas are running around my mind without taking a concrete form yet. I am willing to produce all the graphics myself, with bright colors and a high contrast relation between background/foreground, without any intermediary elements, a design that will make both the *logo *and *design *pop out, without over-filling the background with distractive images, but still have it be astounding.

I wonder if you\'ve ever heard of M.C.Escher, for me one of the greatest artists of all times, an artist who new how to blend the illusion with the art, creating a deeply emotional kind of art that seemed almost magical. I wish to produce a design for both my website and blog that will share that ability, and create in the reader the illusion/delusion of *art*. 

Hopefully you\'ll soon be able to see here in this blog that idea coming to a concrete shape, and materializing into my definite public appearance.  
For the moment you\'ll have to cope with this !

Thanks to all of you readers,  
Alex
