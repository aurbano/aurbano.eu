this is quite a neat trick, and it can look really good depending on your design and the image you put as backgroundâ€¦

To get it to work all you need is to apply a padding and display:block; to the image. So the CSS would be:

    img{
    	display:block;
    	padding:10px;
    	background-image:url(image.gif);
    }
    

[Here is a very smart use of this technique][1], where a div contains the sky, the image is a little man running, with an animated background that simulates motion.

Read [the post][2] that explains how that was achieved if you have any doubts.
