A couple days ago a friend of mine asked me to help him with his computer. Usually that is no problem, but he had *really* done something strange, and he lived too far for me to go there,

Surely there are several options out there when we are talking about remote access software, from the built-in technical assistance in windows to professional solutions, but there is one that I think stands out:

## Proxy PRO 6:

![Workstation][1]  
The Proxy PRO 6 offers a lot of capabilities that standard software doesn’t, first of all, security. You have 256-bit encryption – the highest in its class, which ensures the integrity of your data, along with strong authentication.  
Along this, you can create rol-based groups, with different permissions or capabilities, making it a perfect solution for businesses and technicians.

As for the actual control, it offers a huge set of built-in stuff, like a chat, to talk with the client, bulk file transfer, multi-monitor… etc the list is so big I can’t even remember all the items! But you can always [go to their site][2] to check the full list of features

So basically, if you are thinking about using some sort of [remote control software][3], consider at least the Proxy PRO 6.
