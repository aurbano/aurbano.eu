Here is the article I generated:

> Foreign I just got slapped with a wet salmon – really – I have not updated this since they invented sliced bread… You would not believe that I actually have a life. I prostrate myself in sorrow and beg thy forgiveness..
> 
> I am lost in a sea of pseudo-olde-english with setting fire to people wearing Crocs, learning to speak Japanese, just generally being the life of the party to various lawyers I met recently, my day is full to overflowing from the light through yonder window breaks to I feel like going to bed. I am happy with that. life happens.
> 
> I go, my lords and ladies; just I will blog more regularly. You wanna test me? The Piccaninnies say I have to!.

Try for yourself!
