Have you ever felt like your blog is not reaching the targeted audience? Maybe it is because the major blogging sites don\'t even know who you are!  
Obviously the first step is to claim your blog in all majors, like Technorati for example, but pinging to only two or three doesn\'t really do the trick right?

Well here is a solution, add to your ping list a very wide range of blogging sites that will make sure that your blog at least *exists *.

Another tool you might want to give a try is [Ping-o-Matic][1], which (in case you never heard of it) pings some major blogging sites too.

If after all this you still don\'t get the visitor\'s you think you should, then you must probably reconsider the topic you blog about! ![;)][2]
