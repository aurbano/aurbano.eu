You can of course try to follow all the care and maintenance tips listed on your manual, but this is not a fool proof way to escape the trouble. But you need not to worry since you can always follow steps that could somehow boost PC performance. Read on. 

One of the most sensible steps to do is to perform regular registry clean-up using a [registry cleaner][2]. All kinds of operating system would make use of the registry as a centralized database where all of the hardware and software will be stored. This is the main reason why the registry continuously grows every time data are accessed, removed, or added which will eventually get damaged through time. Registry may augment the data access time for each computer, slow the process, and worst, makes the PC unbootable.

You can as well clean up and defrag the hard drive in order to boost PC performance. It is a common knowledge for every PC owner that the hard disk never fails to get clogged by different unnecessary files, programs, and cookies. To solve the problem, it is vital that you make use of Disk Cleanup utility which is already seen on the system tools of your [Windows XP][3] and Vista. Moreover, it is also advisable that you defrag regularly through the use of the Disk Defragmenter.

And despite the fact that visual effects are one basis in determining a good computer, they will merely consume too much space hence leading again to poor PC performance. Moreover, they devour too much of system resources hence PC slow down is expected. In view of this, no matter how much you wish to see them on your screen, it will mean a lot if you simply limit their use. 

Regular malware scan is also needed. Malware programs like Trojans, adware, spyware, viruses, malicious software and worms can in fact slow down the performance of your PC. Worst, these programs would as well add malicious files that create system errors that can lead to extreme damage on your PC.

Lastly, take caution in installing application on your system since these can add up to the load when your system starts up. The worst thing about them is that some of these would continue to run in the background even if you are not in need of them. Hence, for you to hinder this possible slow-down, simply disable those unnecessary programs from loading when the system is starting up.

These simple steps are a sure way to boost PC performance, never fail to do these on your PC.
