After having been a member of the [frihost.com][1] forum for more than two years, and having posted more than 500 posts I can say and justify that it is absolutely the best web development forum out there.  
First of all you\'ll be given the opportunity to get your own free web hosting with them, the requirements are 10 quality posts and being active in the forums.  
The web hosting features are:

 [1]: http://frihost.com

*   250 Mb of space for your entire collection of websites.
*   10 GB of traffic each and every month.
*   1 short free subdomain to be reachable in the whole world (you.frih.net).
*   Php and Perl scripting languages to fulfill all your programming needs.
*   The DirectAdmin control panel to manage your web hosting account.
*   No forced advertisements. Your own ads like google adsense are allowed.
*   Unlimited MySQL databases for all your data.
*   Unlimited subdomains and ftp accounts of all your domains.
*   Unlimited email accounts for your correspondence.
*   Unlimited parked and addon domains for your whole portfolio of websites.

Now only this would have been enough for most web developers who are in need for a wed host. In addition to this there is the [frihost forum community][2], which is the main reason they are able to give out all those goodies !

 [2]: http://www.frihost.com/forums/

There are over 500000 active members (inactive ones are deleted after a set period of time), at the moment of writing there were 733858 articles in the forum, most of which are about web development and gaming... !

A question posted in the webdev categories in the forum usually takes one day to be answered. If you have a code that doesn\'t work, you could post the whole thing there and I assure you that in less than two days someone has read your whole code, found the error and optimized it to work best...

Seriously, if I\'m making this review is only because I feel in complete debt with that forum, which has always helped me with programming problems along the way, some members have given me their feedback on this blog\'s design, and I of course have tried to always answer any question posted on the forum, and today I am sharing with the whole world this great site.

  
Enjoy,
