A driver is a software program that provides instructions that allow a computerâ€™s operating system and various programs to work in congruence with different hard disk devices, controllers, and peripherals hooked up to your computer. A couple of errors relating to drivers may sometimes occur. These errors are generally caused by corrupt, missing, erroneous, or unsuited divers. To prevent these errors, it is important to have the operating system and device drivers appropriately updated. Regular antivirus and cleanup scans should also be performed to pin point and eradicate erroneous data. 

## Potential Drive Errors and Their Solution:

Improper connection of device to computer. To correct this, frequently inspect the cabling between the device and the computer to locate any loose connection. If a card or adaptor is being used, make sure that both are properly inserted in the appropriate slot. 

Errors in device drivers. This problem arises when the driver is a buggy, poorly designed, incompatible with the operating system, when the recent driver update is faulty, or when there is a hardware divergence within the system. To address this problem, keep each component driver updated accordingly. 

## Resolving XP Drive Errors

Typically, [driver errors][1] in Windows XP can be addressed with the Device Manager tool as this presents information pertaining to the devices hooked up to your computer. With the Device Manager, you can revert to a previous driver update, and install or uninstall a new one. To access the Device Manager, click on Start, Control Panel, System, Hardware, and then Device Manager.

## Potential XP Drive Errors and Their Solution:

Drive error caused by recent driver update. If this problem occurs, it would be best to install the previous driver version. To do this, access Device Manager, specify the problematic device, select Driver Tab, and click Roll Back Driver. 

**Outdated driver:** This can cause [computer errors][2] which can be resolved by installing the latest driver version. Then, in Device Manager, select the problematic device, click on Driver tab, and then click on Update Driver. Perform the instructions presented on how to upgrade the driver to the version that was previously downloaded.

**Corrupt driver:** When a driver is corrupt, your best option is to download and install a recent driver version. Remember to uninstall the old driver first, restart your computer, and then install the new driver.

Driver errors can also be resolved by the Recovery Console. To access this feature, boot your computer with Windows XP CD-Rom. On the Welcome to Setup screen, select R and then log on to the Recovery Console by using the administrator password and typing in the command cd windowssystem32drivers. To change the name the faulty driverâ€™s driver file, run ren Driver\_Name.sys Driver\_Name.old. To resolve the driver error, copy the original driver file from XPâ€™s installation CD-Rom to the driver folder by running copy CD-Drive:i386 Driver_Name.sys. You can then exit the Recovery Console and restart your computer. If these procedures do not resolve the problem, the error probably lies in the hardware, which should thus be repaired or replaced. 

## Registry Problems

A [registry cleaner][3] software can be used to keep the registry healthy. This is achieved by locating and deleting erroneous and damaged entries from the [windows registry][4]. These entries, when unchecked, will eventually cause drive errors.
