I mean seriously, the people who write those spam emails got to be kidding us! A spam email just looks “so” much like spam it’s just pathetic! I had to write this because I am fed up of stupid emails that make no sense and go directly to my trash folder without even reading them

First things first, the subject, I mean seriously, putting *viagra*? *Free credit*? If you want people to open a message, there are some things you must avoid in subjects:

*   Website urls
*   Words like *free*, *gift*, *money*, *credit*.. etc
*   Please stop using *FW:*, it’s like screaming you are a useless email!

Of course there are many more things, but the list is simple unending! Basically, if I wanted someone to open an email, I guess I would fake a reply or a comment, because those are the kind of emails that you don’t expect, and still sometimes we open them to see the comment, as in youtube for example.

Now in the body, there are things called **spam detectors**! So cramming your email with 50 emails, and all of them with porn-related words, free stuff, or things like that doesn’t help!  
And the next big thing, is it really that hard to spell check the email? I have received things like “Dear mr sir Alex, We want informer you of free gift we give to you…” and so on…

The keyword here is to *Look Professional*. If you want to be taken seriously, do things seriously. Until you do that, you are just wasting your time!
