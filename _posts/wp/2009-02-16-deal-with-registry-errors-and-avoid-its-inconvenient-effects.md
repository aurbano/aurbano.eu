For those who are just starting to learn about the many components of the computer’s operating system, it’s very important to start in familiarizing with the registry. This is because all information that is related to the hardware and software configuration of the computer; the system and network systems as well as user profiles are accessed, modified and stored in it. Every time a change is made to the system, the registry takes note of it all. 

Errors are generally caused by the presence of obsolete and outdated entries in the registry. This are entries that are left deleted automatically the moment they are not already useful. After a long time they can accumulate which leads to the production of holes or empty spaces in the registry. Aside from that, these leads to the registry’s corruption, damage as well as its fragmentation. If not properly dealt with, it can cause various problems especially in the overall performance of the computer system. 

Another common cause of [registry errors][1] is the presence of malwares such as viruses, worms, adwares, spywares and Trojans. They add a lot of unwanted data and information, which is often permanent or very difficult to remove at all, within the registry. Not only does it affect the registry, it also damages files and programs as well. This can lead to the freezing of the computer system and even damage to the hardware itself.
