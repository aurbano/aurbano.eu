Hi all visitors,  
It\'s been a very intense week, with the launch of this blog, and the writing of my starting articles, and I want to thank all my visitors and readers for their support. I have received over 3000 unique visits in the last 3 days, with over 1000 visits per day. I am very proud of it, but I am even more proud of the help you all have given this blog by submitting it to social bookmarking sites.

Talking about bookmarking sites, my article [play with the food][1] has been the most popular, and it has been selected as the number one blog entry for the campaign [“All Blogs on One Vine”][2]
