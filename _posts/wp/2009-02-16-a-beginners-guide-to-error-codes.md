The appearance of an error code in a computer screen usually signify that something is going wrong or are not functioning the way that it is supposed to be. It usually comes in the form of numbers or a group of numbers and letters which can signify different meanings and messages all of them indicating that failure have occurred and what needs to be done to the computer system. 

For most computer users, these can be baffling especially if you are not familiar with the different meanings that are attached to the different codes. The fact that there are more than 50 codes also contributes to confusion that can result from the appearance of one. The meanings of each error code can range from missing drivers and damaged system files to application failures and insufficient memories. 

[Computer Errors][1] codes are originally designed to be used by developers and software support staff. This is because they allow anyone, even those who are not professionals to work on the problem consistently and in an organized manner. Aside from that error codes can also be best described as a shortcut for the different problems or failures that can possibly occur to computers. By using numbers or letters, all the different types can be easily remembered, catalogued and be accessed every time it is needed. However, memorizing all the different error codes can still be very bothersome so itâ€™s good to know that a complete list is available online.

Knowing what error codes are is just the first step in familiarizing with them. The next thing that you must know is how to deal with them. You can do this better if you are familiar with the type of error code that has occurred. This is because the approaches for each code differ depending on their meanings or effects on the computer system. For example, a code 1 appears on your computer screen. This means that a device has malfunctioned because it has no drivers installed or the drivers that are present are not correctly set or configured. To resolve this, you may be asked to update the driver that is the cause of the problem.

Other codes such as 15, 16 and 31 can mean that a specific system file is damaged and helps in making the search for the specific system file much easier. For error codes 400 and 500, it usually means that a computer has been neglected and not properly maintained for a very long time.  
A [code 10 error][2] usually occurs because of a malfunctioning or missing driver. It could also occur because of incomplete device driver files. On the other hand, a [code 39 error][3] may occur because your CD-ROM drive is not visible in My Computer. Similar to these errors, a [runtime error 429][4], a software error, occurs when there is a problem with the automation server that is required by MS Office applications.

In spite of the many different meanings that are associated with the many different error codes, all of them signify only one thing. Something is wrong with your computer. However itâ€™s good to know that error codes can easily be prevented especially if you regularly keep and maintain the working physical condition of your computer. These can be done by regular system scans and updating important programs and softwares such as antivirus and registry cleaning tools. If it still appears and you still donâ€™t know what do with it, then it will not hurt to ask for help from any professional technician or troubleshooter.
