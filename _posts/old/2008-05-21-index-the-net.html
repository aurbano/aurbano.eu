Contribute to the indexing of Internet, <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/5362">get the Alexa toolbar</a>.

<img src="http://client.alexa.com/common/images/logowebSearch.gif" alt="Alexa" align="right" />The reason why I'm telling you this is not that I've been paid for it (I wish that happened ;) ), but that Alexa is making a very honorable effort to index the Internet, assigning one unique ranking number to every single website. The way they do this is by measuring visits per million, and the way they measure visits is with the Alexa toolbar. Every user that has it sends his visits to the Alexa server, and there they are added to the count.

So it will provide two useful things:
<ol>
	<li>You'll get to know the ranking of every site you visit. That'll give you an idea of its importance.</li>
	<li>You'll be helping the index of Internet!</li>
</ol>

Thanks!
Alex
