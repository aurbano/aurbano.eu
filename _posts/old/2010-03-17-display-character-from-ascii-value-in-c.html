I don't know whether this is useful or merely entertaining, but it is quite simple to display the character representation of any ASCII number in C++

We will use the static_cast function to perform this operation, converting from int to char.
Let me show you this sample program that does just that (Looping until you enter 0)
<pre lang="cpp" lineno="1">#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main(){
    int r;
    cout < < "Enter a number to see its character: \n" << "Number: ";
    cin >> r;
    while(r!=0){
        cout < < "\nCharacter: " << static_cast<char>(r);
        cin.get();
        cout < < "\nNumber: ";
        cin >> r;
    }
    return 0;
}</iostream></pre>
As you can see we simply ask for a number, and while that number is not 0 we keep on asking for more, as well as displaying its character representation by using the static_cast function.

Hope you enjoyed this ;)
