Are you creating a new forum, IRC channel, or pretty much any kind of website where users can submit links and you need to control bad words?  
Well I was in that situation a few days ago, and it took a very long time until I managed to find some resources, so here I\'ll try to post a bad words list that I\'ll keep on building on as I find more sources.

I won\'t post the bad words list as text, as some public might find it offensive. Instead I\'ll just post a link to a zip file with the badwords.

## Download:

The zip file contains a plain text file with one word per line, and a MySQL file to populate a database with id, word, and replacement.

*   [Bad words list v. 2.0][1] - 3kb (65602 downloads)

 [1]: http://urbanoalvarez.es/blog/?download=badwords

## Change log:

*   Added more words to the list and improved the MySQL one. The list now contains 458 unique words, sorted in alphabetical order.
*   Public release: v. 1.0 - A standard bad words list in a txt file, containing 252 words, plus an SQL script that populates a MySQL database with badwords and their respective \"replacement\" euphemism.

If you know of any good bad words list please comment its URL, so I can add them to this list!
