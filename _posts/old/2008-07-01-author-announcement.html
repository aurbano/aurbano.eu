Hi dear readers:

Some of you might have noticed a lack of articles lately. It is because I'm on holidays right now, actually I've decided to take a break from everything, I'm working at a YMCA camp for the summer, to relax from the clients and from everything.

I still answer email as fast as I can, it doesn't take me longer than 3 days usually, and I answer to all comments here in the blog too, so if you run into any problem feel free to email.

I have to say too that I can notice that summer is here, since the visits have gone up about 22% and it is all thanks to you fellows.

I hope you find the resources here useful, I'll try to write an article or two some day, but mostly I'm looking forward having a break from writing...

Happy summer!
Alex
