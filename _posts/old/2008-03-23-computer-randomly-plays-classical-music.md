Amazing news but totally true... And of course the Operating System that has this strange \"problem\" is... Windows! At least they have corrected it in versions XP 

Apparently when you are using safe mode in any version older than XP, seemingly at random, a piece of classical music starts playing. The two songs they have are \"Fur Elise\" or \"It\'s a Small, Small World\". The real reason though is that the BIOS has detected a fan failure. It is actually a design feature of a detection circuit and system BIOSes developed by Award/Unicore from 1997 on.

You can check out [Microsoft\'s support page][1] on this problem. Weirdly enough they have tried to cover it under the tags \"kbhardware, kbinfo, and KB261186\"... Probably to avoid being found.

It is a fun easter egg I\'d be just amazed to have it happen to me... ![:D][2]   
If you ever experienced it, comment!
