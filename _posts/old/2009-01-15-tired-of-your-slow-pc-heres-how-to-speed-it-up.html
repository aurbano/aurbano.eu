<p>If you are tired with your <a href="http://www.instant-registry-fixes.org/why-is-my-computer-slow/">slow computer</a>, you may be considering calling a computer maintenance professional to help you speed it up. Such services will be commonly available in the proximity of your office or home. While these are great solutions for people who do not mind spending a lot of money, a common computer user may choose to evaluate other available options, before contacting a computer technician.</p>
<p>Listed below are a few of the secrets that computer professionals do not want you to know. Once you know these secrets, you will save money and can maintain the performance of your computer without any external help.</p>

<p><strong>Secret 1: It may be the registry</strong></p>
<p>Computer experts know that many of the computers become slow because a critical part of your operating system known as the <a href="http://www.instant-registry-fixes.org/">Windows Registry</a> needs to be cleaned up. The Windows registry is a data bank containing vital information about the day to day functioning of your computer. The registry may become slow due to several reasons ranging from installation of a large number of programs to not properly removing applications from a computer. This leads to bloating and corruption of the registry and its symptoms include slow down of your PC, <a href="http://www.instant-registry-fixes.org/what-causes-a-registry-error/">registry errors</a> or system crash.</p>
<p>These experts are wary of sharing this reason for slow down of a PC with the user as they donâ€™t want the users to know that registry can be cleaned easily by anyone using a reliable third-party registry tool. This tool can be easily downloaded and installed on your computer. </p>
<p>It is possible that there could be other reasons for a slow down of your computer, but scanning and repairing your Windows registry can improve the speed of many systems.</p>
<p><strong>Secret 2: It may be the Clutter in your Hard Disk</strong></p>
<p>Your Hard disk is like a house and it needs regular housekeeping. Now, you may choose to appoint a housekeeper (a computer expert) to clean up your hard disk, every once in a while, or you can take things into your own hands. Performing regular cleaning of your hard disk is good housekeeping and will save you a lot of time and money. It is similar to preventive maintenance which reduces the chances of a slow-down of your computer.</p>

<p>There are two important tools that have been provided by your operating system manufacturer.</p>
<ol>
  <li>Disk Cleanup: It is a maintenance tool provided by Microsoft to free hard disk space. It performs cleaning of the hard disk by searching, analyzing and then deleting unnecessary files.</li>
  <li>Disk Defragmenter: It is a program which has been created to help improve the speed of accessing files in a hard disk by rearranging them in a proper, contiguous manner.</li>
</ol>
<p>If you use these two system tools on a regular basis, you may find that the speed of your computer is improved dramatically. </p>
<p><strong>Secret 3: It may be a Virus</strong></p>
<p>Many malicious software like virus, Trojans or spyware that manage to enter your system may be the reason behind the slowdown of your computer. Therefore, it is advisable that your computer must be equipped with a reliable anti-virus and anti-spyware tool. This will not only protect your computer from slowdown, but will also prevent any serious damage to your computer or the important data it contains.To get the best out of these tools, you must update them and run thorough scans on your computer on a regular basis.</p>
