Hi to all,

This is my first official post here, where I wish to introduce myself and my blog, 

My personal info can be found in the about me tab, top right corner, so I won\'t go in there much... The topics I wish to cover are mainly web-related, since that is my job and occupation...Â  I program in php and javascript mostly, so those will be my two main categories for writing.

My aim is to write approximately one entry per day, and if one day I forget to write an article, I\'ll try to write two articles the next day, to keep up with my writing \"speed\".

I really look forward to receiving feedback and comments, so please feel free to post a comment whenever you want, no moderation is required at the moment, although if I start getting too much spam I might have to set it up...

Thanks to all, this is all for today!

Alex
