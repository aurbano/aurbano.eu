<p>When working on your Windows computer, you may encounter many computer errors that may stop you from working normally. Many users who are not technically well-acquainted with computers may find themselves seeking expensive external help to resolve these errors. To prevent you from having to do this, and to help you understand common causes of computer errors, some tips that you can use to resolve many different types of errors have been listed below. <br />
  <br />
<strong>Tip # 1</strong>: <a href="http://www.fastpcfixes.com/pc/dll-errors/">DLL errors</a> such as the “<a href="http://www.instant-registry-fixes.org/how-to-fix-msvcr71dll-errors/">msvcr71.dll was not found</a>” error usually occur if a program installation or removal process overwrites or deletes one or more required DLL files. To resolve these errors, you may perform one of the following tasks:</p>

<ul>
 <li>If you have recently installed an application, try to check for its updates and if you find any, install them. If this does not work, you may attempt to download an updated version of the DLL file(s) causing the error on your computer and register them. You may also try to use the System Restore tool to revert your system to the time when the application was not installed on the PC. </li>
 <li>If the DLL error follows a program removal process, reinstall this program. Now, when you uninstall this program, remember to retain the shared DLL files on the system. </li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Tip # 2</strong>: To prevent errors due to outdated and incompatible files, you must remember to regularly update your operating system, software and device drivers. Updating your system, not only helps in enhancing system performance, but also helps in preventing the many security threats that are built around the security vulnerabilities that are patched up by these updates. </p>
<p><strong>Tip # 3: </strong>Computer errors may also occur due to registry problems. Problems within the registry are triggered by the unwanted obsolete, invalid, and malicious information that accumulates within the registry. To prevent these problems, you must regularly scan and clean your registry to remove all this digital junk. Although the Registry Editor tool is shipped with Windows, it is quite difficult to use. Therefore, it is recommended that you use a reliable registry cleaner tool to perform the task. </p>
<p><strong>Tip # 4: </strong>Program conflicts may cause computer problems when you try to use or install new programs on your computer. For instance, if you already have a firewall, installing a new firewall may cause conflicts. In this case, to resolve the error, you may have to <a href="http://www.instant-registry-fixes.org/how-to-remove-firewall-included-in-windows-xp/">remove the firewall</a> that already exists on the system and then install the firewall software that you want to use. </p>

<p><strong>Tip # 5</strong>: Virus and spyware infections are also a major cause of concern for computer users. These programs may infiltrate your system through many different sources, such as an unprotected Internet connection, open network shares, infected email attachments and external media, and freeware software downloaded from the Web. To resolve errors that are generated due to these malicious programs, you need to thoroughly scan your system to weed out all malicious data and registry entries from within it. You can do this easily with the help of efficient and reliable antivirus and antispyware tools. </p>
