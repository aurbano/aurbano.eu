I wonder if you've ever encountered this, because it must be one of the most estrange errors one could possibly find...

<blockquote style="color:red">Your Password Must Be at Least 18770 Characters and Cannot Repeat Any of Your Previous 30689 Passwords</blockquote>

Apparently it only happens in Windows 2000 and in some rare cases, and there is a solution although it doesn't really work OK...
If you want to see it by yourself follow this steps:
<ol>
	<li>Install Windows 2000 (If you didn't have it)</li>
	<li>Configure it to authenticate against an <a href="http://www.windowsecurity.com/articles/Kerberos-Authentication-Mixed-Windows-UNIX-Environment.html">MIT Kerberos domain</a>.</li>
	<li>Log in to the MIT realm, then press CTRL+ALT+DELETE and select "Change password".</li>
</ol>

Now when you try to type in a new password you will be told that it must be at least 18770 characters long, and different from 30689 combinations!
