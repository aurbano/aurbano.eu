It's common to have a website designed for one country (For example Spain or the UK) and have it in a server elsewhere (In the US for example). You will notice that sometimes when displaying a date this way, it shows the local time at the server!

Instead of manually correcting this time difference there is a much safer way of getting around this issue, using built-in PHP functions:

Take a look at this:
<pre>&lt;?php
$timezone = new DateTimeZone( "Europe/Madrid" );
$date = new DateTime();
$date-&gt;setTimezone( $timezone );
echo  $date-&gt;format( 'H:ia  (D, M jS, Y)' );
?&gt;</pre>
Which would generate the following output (At the time of writing of course!)
<pre>22:52pm (Sat, Apr 17th, 2010)</pre>
As you can see it is extremely easy to set up new timezones and to display dates for those zones specifically. You could even prompt your user for his/her own timezone, or add it as a specific setting for them :)
