As you will notice if you knew this blog, I just changed the design, I am not quite done testing, but I don't care, I like the new design too much to keep it "in the lab" :)

This is not really an article, it's just me, happy, announcing it... :S

If you have any feedback I would love to hear some, bad/good, I don't care. Well, I do, but i want both so I can improve and feel good all together...

Thanks to all,
Alex
