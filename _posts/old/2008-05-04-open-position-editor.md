After a few months after this blog\'s first opening to the public it\'s starting to be hard to keep up posting everyday to maintain the high stats I\'m having, so it would be great if anyone was interested in becoming an editor for this blog.  
All applicants must be web developers and know about current design trends, css, php, MySQL, JavaScript and preferably AJAX and any modern web technology.  
It is not a must-have but it will help a lot if applicants provide a website with their showcase, or a blog they might have at the moment or have had, so I can see writing skills.

At the moment the editors will not receive any payment for the simple reason that this blog does not generate income. Of course if this blog started to advertise seriously, or started an affiliation program that resulted in money earned editors would be paid per post and the payment would go proportional to the stats of the post.

If you are interested address all the information you consider important to me, so I can review them. I\'ll try to review and answer to all applicants as soon as possible, which luckily will be in one or two days.

Thank you,  
Alex
