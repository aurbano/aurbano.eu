I was tirelessly wasting some time on a redesign for a client's website yesterday when I found a great font I actually had installed. Each of the characters is actually a vector image great for web design, here is a preview:
<div align="center">
<img src="http://urbanoalvarez.es/blog/wp-content/uploads/2008/05/webfont.gif" alt="Web Designer Font" title="Web Designer Font" width="250" height="250" class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-160" />
</div>

Anyway, you may download and use the font (It is really useful sometimes :))
<ul>
	<li><a href="[download(webfont)]">Download zip file</a> - 18,2Kb ([downloadcounter(webfont)] downloads)</li>
</ul>
