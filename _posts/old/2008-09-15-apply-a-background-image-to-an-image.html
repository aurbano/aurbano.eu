this is quite a neat trick, and it can look really good depending on your design and the image you put as background...

To get it to work all you need is to apply a padding and display:block; to the image. So the CSS would be:
<pre lang="css">
img{
	display:block;
	padding:10px;
	background-image:url(image.gif);
}
</pre>

<a href="http://www.contentwithstyle.co.uk/resources/img_bg_demo/">Here is a very smart use of this technique</a>, where a div contains the sky, the image is a little man running, with an animated background that simulates motion.

Read <a href="http://ajaxian.com/archives/tip-using-a-background-image-on-an-image">the post</a> that explains how that was achieved if you have any doubts.

Enjoy,
