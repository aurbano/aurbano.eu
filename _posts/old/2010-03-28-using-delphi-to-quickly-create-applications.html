There are lots and lots of quick application builder programs that emerge constantly. Its hard to keep up with them all. You may have the need to create some great applications and then quickly package and turn them into a product that can be sold on a marketplace. In this regard, one software package that always hits the home run for me is Delphi. It first came out as the rapid application builder, then many early adopters were able to quickly see their returns investing on it. Creating a simple hello world is cheerful process that you can do it even on your first day programming delphi. Delphi to me is the visual pascal, or technically its the object pascal. Though a simple hello world application is around 300 kb, complex applications are much more less than what it would consume on other programming platforms.

So whenever i need a widget to promote and market my website, i resort to delphi, which is my fastest way of churning out applications. You may worry about the lack of extensions, never be. Delphi extensions or components by which they are called, are available in large. Those come with a package bundled together referred to as Visual component library. Now, you may have heard of VCL before in Visual C++, this is similar to that. If you can name a component you can get it online, for free or for a little price. One such freely available component is from a team, JEDI project. JEDI's Windows API library makes WinAPI much more accessible. Be it you need to fetch the multiple cpu's processing power or getting a bios version, its possible with a function, nothing could be better than this.

If you feel to try it out before you pay for it, get turbo delphi, which is free and let you see what delphi can really do for you. Like many programming packages, delphi progresses through versions. The one i have is Delphi 7, and still use it to date. Once you test drive with turbo delphi, you can confidently invest in the latest Delphi, which is Delphi 2010. After you have decided that delphi is for you, there are great places to learn this language completely. Places like delphi.about.com is all the meat and potatoes for learning the art of delphi with examples and free source code projects. Its when my learning curve picked up real quick and i became really better at this. Now after a month programming on delphi, im really excited to share my knowledge with you. Be it for creating a rapid application or just playing with it creating toys to expand my creative horizons i go to delphi. Oh i almost forgot, if you want to see the first application i created with delphi, just google, smartsys monitor and happy programming in delphi!
