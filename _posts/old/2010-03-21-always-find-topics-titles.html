You probably struggle to find new topics, and once you do, it's really hard to know how to title them. We want them <em>good, concise, and "juicy"</em>, and that is not easy.

Well, there are lot's of people that read guides on writing, that use this "amazing" titles that "grab" people's attention. But well, who wants to spend that much time only for that?

For us that write tech blogs, it's easy to find the right tools online, and we have them at our fingertips. Imagine I wanted to write an article about the iPhone, what should I write it about?

I will go to <a href="http://www.google.com/insights/search">Google Insights</a> and there I will be able to look at the <strong>trends</strong> for each topic. <em>That </em>is the real secret, what people are<em> looking for</em>, what the <em>want</em>, right now.

So in my example, I will search for iPhone, to see what people want to know about it. At a glance I can see the <em>interest of people</em> on that subject over time, the main world <em>countries of interest</em>, and the best of it all, the <em>exact searches</em> they make!

The top searches for iPhone are:
<ul>
	<li>Unlock iPhone 3.1.3</li>
	<li>TaskPaper for iPhone</li>
	<li>New iPhone Apps</li>
	<li>iPad</li>
	<li>... etc</li>
</ul>
So these are the <em>areas of interest</em> I should focus on. That is what <strong>people want</strong>, so that is what I will be <strong>giving them</strong>.
<h2>Another example:</h2>
Now you can probably start to see the advantages of this method. Let's suppose another case scenario, where I am an iPhone App developer, and I have no idea what to develop!

Let's see what apps people want, so I go again to Google Insight, and search for iPhone Apps, download app, and other keywords that will reveal the top searches for new apps:
<ul>
	<li>PayPal App</li>
	<li>SURFit</li>
	<li>Spotify</li>
	<li>White House App</li>
	<li>Cracked Apps</li>
</ul>
So those are the top searches people make. Note that this are far from being the top apps, they are just what people are looking for. It's important that you distinguish this. When you develop something, it should be completely different from the top solutions that already exist. You must do what people need, and that is what they search. And once you have the idea, inspire its design and usability in the other top solutions for other problems.

Good luck with finding your perfect niches!
