You have a blog and want traffic don't you? Well of course, since that is what makes us blog in the first place! The readers might like to read our stuff, and many times they want to talk to us, and contact forms are really good at that ;)
What I mean is that it is no breaking news that contact forms are actually used, either by potential customers, readers that want to share/correct us or simply by someone who dropped by and wants to say "Hey, nice design".
Whatever the reason is, it is always good to have a contact form, and when I wanted to setup mine I looked for WordPress plugins to do it for me (I'm a bit lazy in that sense) and found some interesting stuff.

First of all we have <a href="http://www.deliciousdays.com/cforms-plugin">cForms</a> which if I had to explain it to someone that knew nothing about this I would simply say, "if you install cForms for your contact form is like wanting to buy a computer simply to browse the web and buying a gaming computer that is the closest thing to a supercomputer one could find". I mean by this that cForms is too much for the average blogger, it has too many things, the first time I saw it I just though "Can I just have a contact form please?", although I ended up liking it.

So if you just want a contact form, good and simple, there are many good plugins out there that do the job perfectly,

<h2><a href="http://chip.cuccio.us/projects/contact-form-ii/">Contact Form ][</a>:</h2>
Which, as they say, "[it] is a WordPress plugin, that offers a simple drop-in contact form in any new/existing post/page". It is a nice plugin although you will never get any support from the author, so be careful on this one.

<h2><a href="http://green-beast.com/beastblog/index.php/2007/01/18/contact-form-plugin/">Contact Form Plugin</a>:</h2>
This plugin changes a bit how the contact forms work, instead of entering a tag withing the content of a page/post, you publish it, and then you paste the URL into the configuration page, a bit weird yes, but in the end it is just as simple.


There are of course many other options available, although this are the most varied ones. What is your favorite?
