Maybe a few of you noticed this on some websites, maybe some of you even use it. 
Right now this works in <em>Safari</em>, <em>Opera</em>, and <em>Konqueror</em> and <em>Firefox 3.x</em>. (I think it doesn't work in Firefox 1 or 2, correct me if I'm wrong)

What I'm talking about is the <strong>text-shadow</strong>, <em>wisely </em>applied to your design, it can give an great touch of elegance to your site.
Here you have an example:
<div align="center">
[caption id="attachment_340" align="aligncenter" width="248"]<img src="http://urbanoalvarez.es/blog/wp-content/uploads/2009/10/bef-aft.gif" alt="Before -&gt; After" title="Before -&gt; After" width="248" height="58" class="size-full wp-image-340" />[/caption]</div>
And here you have a coded example:
<div style="text-shadow:#FFFFFF 0px 1px; background:#CCCCCC; color:#000000; padding:20px; display:inline-block;">Test shadow</div>

<h2>The code</h2>
The CSS for this is very simple, we will simply apply a slight text-shadow, of 1px with no blur, to the text:
<pre lang="css">
.elegant{
text-shadow:#FFFFFF 0 1px;
}
</pre>
This effect works best with dark grey text over light grey background, and it is a very useful style for "2.0" designs.

Hope you enjoyed it!
