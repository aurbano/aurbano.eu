I use for my blog statistics both StatPress and Google Analytics, since both offer different things, and I was checking my referrers to see what do people search to get to my blog, to optimize my text and keywords to rank higher for those keywords, when I found a very strange thing:
Google users usually use relatively "complex" search queries, like the following:

<blockquote>round corners+design+js</blockquote>

<blockquote>how to make a php mirc bot</blockquote>

And that is (I think) the normal thing to do when you are searching right? So then I find that about 0.13% of the total number of visits come from Windows Live, although it is still a pretty high number. And I then in Google Analytics checked to see what were the keywords they were using, and it turns out that about 99% of the people that use Windows Live Search use only ONE keyword!
The arrive somehow to my site searching one word!:
urbano

<blockquote>little
easter
image
design
robots
...</blockquote>

These were the latest search keywords used, and I thought it might be a problem in the way StatPress and Google Analytics get the search query terms from the referrer URI, but when I did a long phrase search and clicked on my blog, the whole query appeared perfectly, so it is true that most Windows Live users really search one word...
Unbelievable, if I had never seen it I would never have thought of it...
