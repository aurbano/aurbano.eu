Hello!
Although this was a nice script back then, it is now very outdated. There are APIs available now that weren't at the moment, so I decided to remove the post.

It basically sent GET requests via cURL in PHP to Google, and then parsed the response looking for your website. It was kind of usefull to see "quickly" how well your website ranked for several keywords.
