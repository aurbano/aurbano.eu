<p>The error codes that accompany various computer errors are not just random numbers. They denote something and are your first step toward identifying the cause of the error. For example, based on the error code, you may determine whether an error is a software error or a hardware error.</p> 
<p>To successfully resolve error codes, you first need to ascertain the cause of the error. Understanding the cause of an error code immensely helps in troubleshooting the error. </p> 
<p>In this article, we will discuss common causes of computer error codes and steps you can perform to resolve them.</p> 
<p><strong>Malware Infection</strong></p> 
<p>Malware infection is the root cause of many computer errors, such as <a href="http://www.instant-registry-fixes.org/understanding-and-troubleshooting-error-0x80040702/">error 0x80040702</a>. Malware programs, such as viruses, rootkits, and trojans are known to modify or delete important files. As a result, an error occurs every time a program tries to access the infected file. </p> 
<p>To resolve errors occurring due to malware infections, perform a malware scan of your entire computer using reliable and advanced antivirus tool and antispyware tool.</p> 
<p><strong>Incorrect installation/uninstallation of programs</strong></p> 
<p>Incorrect or incomplete installation of programs or software also causes various errors. To resolve errors that are a result of incorrect installation, uninstall the program and reinstall it. When installing the program, ensure that the installation setup files are healthy and undamaged. Furthermore, if you are installing the new program using an installation disc, make sure that the installation CD or DVD is unscratched. </p> 
<p>Furthermore, do not install programs that are incompatible with your operating system. Conflicting software may alter or replace important Windows files and cause errors, such as the <a href="http://www.instant-registry-fixes.org/steps-to-fix-c000021a-in-windows-xp/">stop error c000021a</a>. To resolve such errors, remove the software that is causing the error. </p> 
<p>Incomplete unisntallation of programs also leads to various errors. The leftover files or processes of the removed program may interfere with other running processes and cause errors. To ensure complete removal of programs, you may use an advanced and reliable third-party uninstaller tool. </p> 
<p><strong>Outdated Windows, software and driver files</strong></p> 
<p>You may also receive various errors if your Windows or driver files are outdated. This is why it is imperative that you regularly install new updates pertaining to your operating system and drivers.</p> 
<p>To automatically install new Windows updates, enable the Automatic Update feature that is available in Windows XP and later versions of Windows computers. To ensure that your drivers are regularly updated, you may use a reliable and easy to use third-party driver scanner tool. Such tools automatically install new drivers, as and when they are released by their manufacturers.</p> 
<p>Furthermore, also ensure that all your third-party software programs are also regularly updated. Outdated software may slow down your computer or cause errors due to compatibility issues with other computer components or programs.</p> 
<p><strong>Corrupt or damaged registry</strong></p> 
<p>A corrupt or damaged registry may cause innumerable errors, such as <a href="http://www.instant-registry-fixes.org/troubleshooting-error-2739-for-adobe-products-in-vista/">error 2739</a>. To fix your damaged registry and errors caused by it, schedule regular registry scans using efficient registry cleaning software. </p> 
<p><strong>Faulty hardware</strong></p> 
<p>You may also receive various errors if your hardware components, such as memory modules or hard disk, are damaged or corrupt. To resolve hardware related errors, first identify the hardware component that is causing the error and then get it replaced or repaired. </p>
