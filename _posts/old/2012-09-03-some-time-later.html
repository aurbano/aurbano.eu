The last couple of years have been amazing to me, I have traveled, studied, and learned plenty of new things, and it's interesting coming back to the "origins"

This blog was always the place where I shared my findings and interesting things that happened to me, but as time went by I wrote less and less, simply because too many things were on my mind every day. I should have written about my first AdSense check, it felt like the start of a new live! Later on, my first famous website, it was incredible searching it on twitter and finding several tweets everyday about my own creation!
After that things just went crazy, AdSense gained a new meaning for me, I started to optimize the way I placed ads, always experimenting to improve earnings. All at the same time I developed 2 more big websites. At that time I was able to see a blurry shape of what was a good website, from the perspective of making money out of it.

Now I am very excited about the future, all the possibilities it has to offer. This summer I got the best idea so far for one of my websites, and I believe it will be <strong>good</strong>

So, random reader, that is what I've been up to. I'm writing this more for myself than for anyone else,
Maybe next time I write I'll be able to say that my idea was a success, let's hope for the best.

Aim for the moon...
