I just found this orchestra playing the final countdown:  
  
I love the song, and how they play it, but... omg the way the guys in the front play the big contrabass... its just hilarious!

I think that the orchestra name is Apocalyptica, played in Megaman probably... By the way, it just sounds like Arrested Development I guess...
