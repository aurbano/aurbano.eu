If you are a lazy blogger then <a href="http://www.aussiebloggers.com.au/blogpost.html">this tool</a> is for you! It will create blog posts for free for your use!

Here is the article I generated:


<blockquote>Foreign I just got slapped with a wet salmon - really - I have not updated this since they invented sliced bread... You would not believe that I actually have a life. I prostrate myself in sorrow and beg thy forgiveness..

I am lost in a sea of pseudo-olde-english with setting fire to people wearing Crocs, learning to speak Japanese, just generally being the life of the party to various lawyers I met recently, my day is full to overflowing from the light through yonder window breaks to I feel like going to bed. I am happy with that. life happens.

I go, my lords and ladies; just I will blog more regularly. You wanna test me? The Piccaninnies say I have to!.</blockquote>

Try for yourself!
