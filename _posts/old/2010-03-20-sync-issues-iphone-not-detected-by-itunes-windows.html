Note that this is for Windows only!

Some people have been experiencing this problem lately: You plugin in your iPhone, the Camera detected window pops up, iTunes may even open, but the iPhone doesn't sync or even show in the sidebar!

Here is how to fix it:
<ol>
	<li>With the iPhone plugged it, close iTunes</li>
	<li>Go to your <strong>Control Panel</strong></li>
	<li>Open up <strong>Administrative Tools</strong> (This name may vary depending on your language. The icon shows a folder, a computer and a hummer)</li>
	<li>Open up <strong>Services</strong></li>
	<li>Locate the service "<em>Apple Mobile Device</em>"</li>
</ol>
Now open up iTunes, and your iPhone should show up! I have tested this on Windows XP only, if it works for you on other versions please let me know to update the post
