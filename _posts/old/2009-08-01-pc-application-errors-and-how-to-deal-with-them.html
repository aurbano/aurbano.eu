<p>Your Windows  operating system comes packaged with some useful applications such as a word processor,  a spreadsheet, a calculator and so on. However, with the passage of time, you  end up installing several other applications to meet your specific  requirements. If you have a branded PC, there are a number of other applications  which come pre-installed, besides your Windows operating system. </p>
<p>Almost all applications  on your PC add and use DLL files or Dynamic Link Library Files to perform  specific tasks. These DLL files were originally created by Microsoft to improve  the efficiency of Windows operating system. Later, a number of other applications  started using the same DLL files. Furthermore, many application manufacturers  began developing their own DLL files. </p>
<p><strong>Causes of DLL Application Errors</strong></p>

<p>Whether they are  core operating system DLL files or DLLs belonging to a certain application,  most of the DLL files are stored in the Windows directory. This enables easy  access to all applications installed on your computer. With so many DLL files  being used simultaneously by a number of applications, it’s quite natural for  you to encounter application related DLL errors at one time or other.</p>
<p>A malware  infection, a corrupt hard drive, a damaged Windows registry, an accidental  deletion of a critical DLL file or overwriting a newer DLL version with an  older one are some of the reasons which may generate <a href="http://www.dll-error-fixes.com/">DLL error</a> messages. </p>
<p>For example, “<a href="http://www.dll-error-fixes.com/fix-clbdll-application-failed-start-error/">clb.dll application has failed  to start error</a>&quot; and “<a href="http://www.dll-error-fixes.com/fix-xprt5dll-application-failed-start-error/">xprt5.dll  application</a> error” may occur if the given DLL file is either corrupt or  missing. Here, Clb.dll is one of the Windows operating system’s core files. The  xprt5.dll is a part of the XPRT Runtime Library program. This file usually gets  installed with AOL instant messenger. </p>
<p><strong>How to Deal With DLL Application Errors</strong> </p>

<p>Dealing with DLL errors  is not very tough, as long as you take a systematic approach to fix the error. Here  are general steps that you may follow to fix these errors:</p>
<ol start="1" type="1">
  <li>If the file gets deleted by mistake, check the Recycle Bin to see  if it is there. In case you find the missing DLL file, restore it to  resolve the error. You may also use a file recovery software to do the  task. Avoid downloading the missing DLL from an online DLL web site. Many  such DLLs are known to be malware in disguise. You may end up causing more  harm to your PC by using these downloaded DLL files.</li>
  <li>If a system DLL file is missing, replace it by extracting the  original file from the Windows setup CD.</li>
  <li>Install the latest version of the software to which the DLL file  belongs. </li>
  <li>Update your Windows operating system. You can do this by using the  Windows Update tool that comes with Windows. </li>
  <li>Scan and clean your PC from any infections from virus, worms,  Trojans, or spyware. Use reliable and efficient antivirus and antispyware  tools for this task. </li>

  <li>Scan your registry for invalid and incorrect DLL entries. Registry  problems are known to be one of the common causes of several DLL errors.  An easy and efficient method to fix registry DLL errors is by using a  compatible and genuine registry repair tool.</li>
