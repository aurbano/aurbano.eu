I never wanted to work with Joomla, probably because of my believe that it was totally unaccessible and unusable. But I am now testing Joomla 1.5 for the first time, since a client asked me to redesign his Joomla based web site, and organize all of his content to look "professional", and so here I am. I have just installed Joomla on a test server, I've found a theme which I like, and I'll start modifying the theme to be just perfect.

Then I'll have to upgrade my client's Joomla version :S
Apparently it is not an easy task upgrading Joomla Or at least not as easy as running the <a href="http://techie-buzz.com/">Automatic WordPress updater plugin</a> ;)

Well, I'll have to prey to do things the right way ;)
