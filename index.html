<h2>Welcome</h2>
<p>Hello! I'm Alejandro U. Alvarez, an engineering student at <a href="http://www.uniovi.es/inicio/">Universidad de Oviedo</a> (Spain). I started programming during my Freshman year in Brookline High School (Boston, MA), and then got more and more interested in web development. I'm currently involved in many projects, most of them related to social networking. I mainly develop the database schemas and back-end systems. I was inspired to redesign my website by my friend <a href="http://qimingfang.com">Qiming Fang</a></p>
<p>I love new ideas, trying new tools and working with new people. When it comes to work, I love <a href="https://github.com/aurbano">git</a> and apps like Teambox. I'm now working on <a href="https://github.com/Open-RPG/open-rpg">something</a> incredibly exciting!</p>

<p>At the moment I'm in the process of migrating my blog to Jekyll (You are reading the result right now). It will still take a while until I am happy with the result though.</p>
