Well the code is relatively simple, and it gives a good navigation point for users that, if they liked your article, might want to keep reading your stuff.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;If you want to plainly display the next post after the one the user is reading, use the following function:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;div class="highlight"&gt;&lt;pre tabindex="0" style="color:#f8f8f2;background-color:#272822;-moz-tab-size:4;-o-tab-size:4;tab-size:4;"&gt;&lt;code class="language-php" data-lang="php"&gt;&lt;span style="display:flex;"&gt;&lt;span&gt;&lt;span style="color:#a6e22e"&gt;next_post_link&lt;/span&gt;();
&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/code&gt;&lt;/pre&gt;&lt;/div&gt;&lt;p&gt;Now this function has several (very useful) parameters, which are:&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Easily assign an image to a post in WordPress</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-09-11-assign-image-to-wordpress-post/</link><pubDate>Thu, 11 Sep 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-09-11-assign-image-to-wordpress-post/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;Have you ever wondered how to assign an image to a certain post using WordPress? Surely there are some plugins that try to do this, and maybe they accomplish it, but probably slowing down your blog.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;Well, here is a way of doing it without slowing the blog or installing any sort of additional plugins. When you are done writing your post, upload an image to a directory that you will use for this, for example: &amp;quot;www.yoursite.com/post_images/&amp;quot;. And I recommned that you name the image something that has to do with the post, it will help you if you need to edit it.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item><item><title>Changing WP Table prefixes</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-04-14-changing-wp-table-prefixes/</link><pubDate>Mon, 14 Apr 2008 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/wp/2008-04-14-changing-wp-table-prefixes/</guid><description>&lt;p&gt;As a security tip you should always change the default table prefix &amp;quot;wp_&amp;quot;, mainly to avoid zero-day vulnerabilities (Vulnerabilities that haven't been discovered yet), or JavaScript SQL injection.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;A very good tool you could use for that purpose is the &lt;a href="http://semperfiwebdesign.com/plugins/wp-security-scan/"&gt;WP-Security-Scan&lt;/a&gt; plugin, which takes care of all your security problems, including that one.&lt;br&gt;
The problem is that most of the times it is very hard to get it to change the prefix. Because of that you will have to do it manually.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
