And as usual I&amp;rsquo;ve thought, how hard can it be to recreate? So off we go into the next learning adventure!
State of the Art: Boid, Vicsek, Three-Circle, Social force&amp;hellip; There is tons of research into this topic already, which is great because it should make the work a lot simpler!</description></item><item><title>Procedural Map Generation</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2020-02-08-procedural-maps/</link><pubDate>Sat, 08 Feb 2020 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2020-02-08-procedural-maps/</guid><description>At #socialgorithm we recently started working on a new game, let&amp;rsquo;s call it &amp;ldquo;Ant Colony&amp;rdquo; for now. It&amp;rsquo;s a bit like simplified Age of Empires, where you write the code that drives a bunch of ants, and they need to survive and ultimately be the only ones alive in the map.
We needed to generate map procedurally, which is nothing new really, but it was new to me when I started writing the code for it, so it&amp;rsquo;s been a fun opportunity to learn something new!</description></item></channel></rss>
