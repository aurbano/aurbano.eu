Read through the whole thing before judging what you see, then think about it, and then express your opinion.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;h2 id="the-unique-beings-paradox"&gt;The Unique Beings paradox&lt;/h2&gt;
&lt;p&gt;To start off I will check with you certain easy experiments that are the base of this. We both agree that the same set of variables, done in the same order in the same way must always produce the same result. An example of this is that if we had two identical containers full of the same amount of the same water, and using a machine we dropped two identical steel balls of the same mass in the same point of the containers and we recorded each from the same angle and the same lighting we would have exactly identical results in the water, each second of one would match exactly each second of the other, until the water flattened again.&lt;/p&gt;</description></item></channel></rss>
