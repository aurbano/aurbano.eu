He's doing the classic &amp;ldquo;find the n-th prime&amp;rdquo; algorithm, that has a typical recursive solution. It includes a snippet that solves the problem in a way that's just as beautiful as it is impossible to understand for me right now, without any Haskell knowledge.
So I've decided to (finally) start my Journey into Haskell by understanding how that snippet works.</description></item></channel></rss>
