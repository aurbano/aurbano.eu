Which she set herself last time I was with them (because she couldn't remember the previous one). So I saved it in my password manager just in case&amp;hellip;
They basically have all sessions logged in on their phones and computers, and use &amp;ldquo;Forgot my password&amp;rdquo; whenever they actually need to login to anything. Because of that they end up choosing some random new password for each service every time that happens, and obviously forget it the next time they need it.</description></item><item><title>2019 Q4 Update</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/note/2019-12-14-another-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/note/2019-12-14-another-update/</guid><description>After putting this aside for a few years (3 apparently&amp;hellip; ) I finally decided to spend a weekend bringing my personal website back to life.
I wanted a simple setup, that stores my blog on Github and publishes updates automatically. Until now I had been using Jekyll but setting it up was usually non trivial, and things keps breaking over time.
So this time I migrated the blog to Hugo, redesigned a template, and set up Github Actions to publish it automatically.</description></item><item><title>2016 Q1 Update</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/note/2016-04-28-what-im-doing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/note/2016-04-28-what-im-doing/</guid><description>Actions This past year I invested heavily in Angularjs - building a massive application at work (at least it feels massive to me, the front end is at about 20k LOC without dependencies).
At some point I realised that JS wasn't cutting it for our size, Angularjs provided the tools to build, but not to maintain. So I decided to refactor everything into Typescript. Three weeks and many late nights later we had type safety, coding without messing things up was easy and fun again!</description></item></channel></rss>
