He's doing the classic &amp;ldquo;find the n-th prime&amp;rdquo; algorithm, that has a typical recursive solution. It includes a snippet that solves the problem in a way that's just as beautiful as it is impossible to understand for me right now, without any Haskell knowledge.
So I've decided to (finally) start my Journey into Haskell by understanding how that snippet works.</description></item><item><title>2019 Q4 Update</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/note/2019-12-14-another-update/</link><pubDate>Sat, 14 Dec 2019 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/note/2019-12-14-another-update/</guid><description>After putting this aside for a few years (3 apparently&amp;hellip; ) I finally decided to spend a weekend bringing my personal website back to life.
I wanted a simple setup, that stores my blog on Github and publishes updates automatically. Until now I had been using Jekyll but setting it up was usually non trivial, and things keps breaking over time.
So this time I migrated the blog to Hugo, redesigned a template, and set up Github Actions to publish it automatically.</description></item><item><title>2016 Q1 Update</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/note/2016-04-28-what-im-doing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/note/2016-04-28-what-im-doing/</guid><description>Actions This past year I invested heavily in Angularjs - building a massive application at work (at least it feels massive to me, the front end is at about 20k LOC without dependencies).
At some point I realised that JS wasn't cutting it for our size, Angularjs provided the tools to build, but not to maintain. So I decided to refactor everything into Typescript. Three weeks and many late nights later we had type safety, coding without messing things up was easy and fun again!</description></item></channel></rss>
