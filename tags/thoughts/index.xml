At some point I realised that JS wasn't cutting it for our size, Angularjs provided the tools to build, but not to maintain. So I decided to refactor everything into Typescript. Three weeks and many late nights later we had type safety, coding without messing things up was easy and fun again!</description></item></channel></rss>
