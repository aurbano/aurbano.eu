This will be just fine for regular iPhones of course, but for the people who have a Jailbroken iPhone, it's not ok (At least until the newest version is ready for jailbreak)
Well don't panic since this is a really simple thing to do, first, download the iPhone firmware you want to restore into.</description></item></channel></rss>
