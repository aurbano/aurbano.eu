Developed by Mike Davidson and Mark Wubben, it allows you to change the fonts used in your website to custom fonts without having to worry about them in the user's computer.
How this is accomplished is actually &amp;ldquo;very simple&amp;rdquo;. First of all you need a folder with all your fonts (.ttf files), then a JavaScript file has to be called from your html pages which will first check if Flash is enabled, and then if it is it will read through the code and determine where it should insert the flash movies.</description></item></channel></rss>
