I wanted a simple setup, that stores my blog on Github and publishes updates automatically. Until now I had been using Jekyll but setting it up was usually non trivial, and things keps breaking over time.
So this time I migrated the blog to Hugo, redesigned a template, and set up Github Actions to publish it automatically.</description></item><item><title>2016 Q1 Update</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2016-04-28-what-im-doing/</link><pubDate>Thu, 28 Apr 2016 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2016-04-28-what-im-doing/</guid><description>Actions This past year I invested heavily in Angularjs - building a massive application at work (at least it feels massive to me, the front end is at about 20k LOC without dependencies).
At some point I realised that JS wasn&amp;rsquo;t cutting it for our size, Angularjs provided the tools to build, but not to maintain. So I decided to refactor everything into Typescript. Three weeks and many late nights later we had type safety, coding without messing things up was easy and fun again!</description></item><item><title>Mac: Shanghai to Spain</title><link>https://aurbano.eu/post/2014-10-21-mac-shanghai-to-spain/</link><pubDate>Tue, 21 Oct 2014 00:00:00 +0000</pubDate><guid>https://aurbano.eu/post/2014-10-21-mac-shanghai-to-spain/</guid><description>I just ordered a new Macbook Air, exactly when the October 16th Keynote was over (In case they presented a new one with retina display).
So now I can only wait for it to arrive, quite excited about this, since it means getting new technology I&amp;rsquo;m not used to. It&amp;rsquo;s a pity they don&amp;rsquo;t offer express shipping, UPS takes 7 days to get it to Spain.
In order to make the wait less painful I did a quick script to parse the UPS tracking page and draw the locations on Scribble Maps:</description></item></channel></rss>
