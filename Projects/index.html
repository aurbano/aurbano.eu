			<h1>nuophoto <small>2013</small></h1>
			<p>HTML5, canvas, JavaScript experiment. I've always been interested in image manipulation, so I decided to build this. It does image processing using convolution matrices.</p>

			<p>It's a mix of two different libraries, all created from scratch for this project: a GUI controller and an image editing library.</p>

			<h2>PhotoJShop</h2>
			<p>While doing this project I became very interested in image editing, and also built a library called <a href="http://urbanoalvarez.es/PhotoJShop/">PhotoJShop</a>, that does convolution transformations to images allowing common effects like find edges, emboss, edge enhance, blur...</p>

			<h1>VayaCoñazo <small>2013</small></h1>
			<p>An entertainment site, mixing an RSS aggregator and a "rage comic" site where users submit their content. It pulls content from its own database and a lot other sources, combining everything on the same feed.</p>
			<p>There is also a <a href="http://vayacoñazo.com/tv.php">video viewer</a> that displays the latest videos in a nice AJAX interface, I actually use the video viewer quite more often than the actual site, it's a nice way to spend 10 minutes. Every single video that ever goes viral or becomes famous appears on this viewer some time before. I'm also planning on making an app for it.</p>

			<h1>Cloudclient <small>2012</small></h1>
			<p>An experiment integrating an API with JavaScript. It's fully open source if you want to take a look. I would love to have more time and do the whole thing again, perhaps one day. The goal with this was to practice some JavaScript, and also because I though I could do an amazing interface for cloud storage services. I did learn a lot of JavaScript, while failing to do an amazing interface. I might revisit it at some point and try to improve it a bit.</p>
			<p>The full source code can be found on Github, there might be some useful parts.</p>
			<p>It's online at <a href="http://Cloudclient.es">Cloudclient.es</a>, if you want to give it a go (A recent API change broke it, I'll fix it as soon as possible)</p>

			<h1>Que Piensas <small>2011</small></h1>
			<p>Spanish (failed) social network fully integrated with Facebook. It alows users to express their opinion on their friends. I'm still sure that this idea can become popular, it's just that we didn't achieve the right user experience. Building everything from scratch was a serious effort that helped us learn a lot, but made development too slow. We had no reusable CSS or components, no MVC architecture, nothing really... </p>
			<p>At some point I will surely give it another go, although this time as an app, they have far more potential I think.</p>
			<p>It was build from scratch by <a href="http://jaicab.com">Jaime Caballero</a> and me. It uses jQuery, lots of (awful) AJAX and a PHP backend.</p>
			<p>Available in <a href="http://Quepiensas.es">Quepiensas.es</a></p>

			<p>Entertainment site featuring many popular tools and services. Also a chat, forum, and many other sections that users discover over time.</p>
			<p>This was mostly done to experiment with some new things, but it got quite popular in Spain so I kept on working on it.<br />
