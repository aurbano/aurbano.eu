I've started developing plugins for WordPress (An entertainment which I find enormously entertaining ;) ) and I decided to put the ones that I publish here on a list for the "ease of navigation" I guess.

Currently I only have one plugin ready, so the "list" is not that long, but I hope to get this going after a few months with at least one or two more plugins.
<ol>
	<li><a href="http://urbanoalvarez.es/blog/custom-fonts-plugin/">Custom Fonts Plugin</a> - Customize the fonts in your blog using sIFR technology.</li>
	<li><a href="http://urbanoalvarez.es/blog/nospam/">Nospam</a> - The ultimate spam fighting plugin (And also completely invisible!)
</li></ol>

Thanks for coming!
By the way, if you want to be notified when I publish a new plugin or something, just comment below saying so or contact me directly.
