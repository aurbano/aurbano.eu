I live in London, UK. It's starting to be spring!

I'm testing a new version of this website, where I plan on keeping things more up to date.

That means that I have to redesign it so I like it more, so it has a cleaner structure, and so I can work on it from wherever.

I'm making more music with my soon-to-be wife now, I've bought a new MIDI controler (A Komplete Kontrol s61) and upgraded from Garage Band to Logic Pro. So soon I'll be able to post a link to our first song!
