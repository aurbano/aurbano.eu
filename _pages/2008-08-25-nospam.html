This is the placeholder for the future page of the plugin "Nospam".

At the moment I am working on the first stable release, so there is nothing to be seen around here... I'll give you a preview of the Settings page of version 1:
<div><img src="http://urbanoalvarez.es/img/blog/nospam.jpg" alt="Nospam sneak peak" /></div>
More information about how the plugin will work <a href="http://urbanoalvarez.es/blog/2008/08/23/best-unobtrusive-anti-spam-technique-not-captcha/">in the presentation article</a>.
The plugin should be hopefully launched before the end of this week :)
