I guess this is a small autobiography of sorts. Instead of trying to figure out who may be reading this and write something for them, I'll write this for myself.

For up to date info on me check my ["now" page](/now).

## I create things

That sums up my main interest, I like making things. It tends to be software, but I do electronics, make music, websites... new ideas in general.

I also love **learning** different things, I read as much as possible for that, and keep on throwing myself into things I know nothing about - which sometimes works well and mostly doesn't!


My software things are divided between [projects](/projects), [libraries](https://github.com/aurbano), and [little experiments](/labs). I used to develop one large personal project a year, but that proves very time consuming and ultimately not that useful.
So I focus more on libraries and experiments now (not that those are a lot more useful, but I'm able to get more things done this way).

I really enjoy making music, skiing, [radio controlled](/rc) machines, and travelling around. For more info please get in touch or check our the social links top-right :)
