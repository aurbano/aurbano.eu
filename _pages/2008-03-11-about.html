<h2>Introduction:</h2>
Hello everyone, my name is Alejandro Urbano, a website and software developer currently established in the north of Spain. I am now studying telecommunications engineering, a career centered in signal processing and software development.

I have been designing, developing and creating websites for several years now, ranging from social networks, simple applications, personal pages... etc which has given me enough experience to work in any project I find interesting
<h2>Why this blog?</h2>
Why not?
<h2>Inspiration:</h2>
I always write about things that puzzle me, either with solutions or pieces of advice I've found useful. This blog's been around since 2008, I've learnt a lot since I started writing here, so early entries might be a bit terrible!

Thanks to all of you out there who visit my blog, remember this blog is part of <a href="http://urbanoalvarez.es">my website</a>, where you can find <a href="http://urbanoalvarez.es/portfolio.php">my portfolio</a> and quite a lot of information about me and my work...
<h2>Past themes:</h2>
As time went by since the start of this blog in 2008, website "fashion" has changed quite a bit, so here are some screenshots of my past themes. I developed myself only the first ones, I guess I've become too lazy nowadays...

Somewhere after Version 3 I started using public themes, after some years I prefer simple and clean designes...

<a href="http://urbanoalvarez.es/blog/wp-content/themes/grunge/screenshot.png"><img src="http://urbanoalvarez.es/blog/wp-content/themes/grunge/screenshot.png" alt="Current theme for Urbano's Blog" width="100" class="alignleft" /></a>
<strong>Version 3: </strong>
This complete redesign was done ground up from scratch, although the idea had been flying around my head for quite a while.
I wanted it to be grunge, the artwork, with vivid bold colors, I was sick of my dull previous design. I also wanted to have some sort of originality and give a sense of boundless options of design, break of conventions and simply let go with the design elements (As you can probably tell from the comments stylign, the forms, the RSS link... )

<a href="http://urbanoalvarez.es/blog/wp-content/themes/redesign/screenshot.png"><img class="alignleft" title="Version 2" src="http://urbanoalvarez.es/blog/wp-content/themes/redesign/screenshot.png" alt="Version 2" width="100" style="width:100px !important;" /></a>
<strong>Version 2:</strong>
This one is a bit larger, if you click on the screenshot you'll see it. I kind of like this design even now (2012), it had nice colors, the usual layout...
I was playing with transparencies and png, which at the time was very tricky, so there was a lot of JavaScript just to fix things in IE.
<div style="clear: both;"></div>
Earlier versions were lost over time...
<h2>My RSS feed:</h2>
People still use this? Well I guess with the increased number of smartphone and tablet users, more people will get into RSS readers. I think I had a feed in feedburner, not sure anymore
