## Me in 10 seconds

I have a passion for design and code, and the way they work together. I love taking ideas from a whiteboard to a product, and to happy users.

**JavaScript** (in any flavour + framework), **Java**, **Docker** and **Postgres** are my typical weapons of choice when building something, but I never shy away from something different!

When I'm not typing at a keyboard I can be found making music, playing some videgames, or getting married (soon!)
