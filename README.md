==================

My personal website, hosted here on Github. I have moved my blog here as well, using Hugo for it's management. I migrated it from Jekyll, which I had migrated from WordPress. Migrating from Wordpress took a bit of time but using some plugins and spending a little time fixing things up it was easy.

The web/blog can be accessed with the usual address: <del>http://urbanoalvarez.es</del> https://aurbano.eu
