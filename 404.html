<p>Hey!</p>

<p>I migrated my blog from Wordpress to Github + Jekyll, and deleted most of my old posts when doing so. I'm sorry if you were looking for some of the old content but it really wasn't of any use from my point of view.</p>

<p>All the posts that were about short code snippets were saved as <a href="https://gist.github.com/aurbano">public Gists</a> on my account though.</p>
