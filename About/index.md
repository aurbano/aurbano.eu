Hello! I'm Alejandro U. Alvarez, an engineering student at [Universidad de Oviedo](http://www.uniovi.es) (Spain). I started programming during my Freshman year in Brookline High School (Boston, MA), and then got more and more interested in web development. I'm currently involved in many projects, most of them related to social networking. I mainly develop the database schemas and back-end systems.

I love new ideas, trying new tools and working with new people. When it comes to work, I love [git](https://github.com/aurbano). For the past years I've become very interested in security, both for web, mobile and desktop applications, and spend some of my time researching into that.

At the moment I'm in the process of migrating my blog to Jekyll (You are reading the result right now). It will still take a while until I am happy with the result though.
